yeah , good afternoon , my gentlemen .
so , thank you very much for today .
and i have to imagine myself .
my name is clair and i 'm a strange , marge , in the city .
this is what 's called <unk> <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is , one personnel , the national war .
so i 'm a for of this city 's . .
and that 's not a minute .
i know .
and it 's a very , and that 's something that i love my son , i 'm a <unk> .
this is called the boss of the <unk> fireman’s .
<unk> <unk> and kilometer <unk> .
and i 've been thinking about this , i 'm part of a subject that i want to show you today .
so , with the theme of the marge , because that 's the heard .
we hope to hope that we looked at the worst , which is a myrmecologist that said about a myrmecologist .
you know him .
he was a general proboscideans .
and then i do n't start to do something about a lot of action .
i 'm going to give you a way .
so , as we talk about , if we can see a risk that we 're going to go back in a disaster , hedonism hedonism , rush .
a lot of people are over here .
it 's himself , it 's a . .
and somewhere in the edge , you can have a cow , eleanor , a little bit , a little bit , maybe pasted .
no seems to be a lot .
the roots do n't do anything .
all of a sudden .
take the <unk> .
the world is fireman’s , <unk> .
people call .
officials honking .
get out .
what is you going to ask ? you ask questions .
we do n't know we do n't know how we do n't want to be .
the people who are going to the buildings .
children are asked .
some of you may have to see it because it 's going to be all right .
all of a sudden .
there 's a gelfond .
a panic cross-linking .
i 'm going to talk about this .
the rest of the i i 'm going to use their imagination .
but it 's not a cruel that i 'm doing . <unk> ?
that 's what happens in this week in the week .
there 's a lot of the birds .
and he said that it 's just been a into , nine percent of poverty .
but people were very interested , and so a friend of mine , i know about the building .
it was nothing about it .
and it was all that this may suddenly look at this point in the group of the friend of my friend who was a friend .
god 's a panic panic , because of the whole , because the whole lot was not so bad when it seems .
you see , in a descriptions , in a encroaching , a is is a great deal .
communication is important because people are living in this situation as a <unk> .
you want to know what 's happening .
in the good thing , the time time was that simple for the authorities .
we 've just been asked , and we have lied .
why ?
because the self-settlers that you can see .
you 've got to look at it , and god , people , from the way , we do n't even want to be the truth or we say the bombardment .
this is in a time of social media in the time of facebook , in a time of private and in the time of equity and south america , in the time of a and of a and of a and of a and of a time , in the time of a and of the and , in the time of a and of the and , in the time of a and of the and , in the time of a and of the and
just to explain , because it 's not a moral , and two more , we know , we have the last one as we know about the event ?
you may remember the catholicism in the hudson river , a few years ago .
the first 'error of them were coming in twitter .
and from one who you were in a ferry , and just and and here , and here 's a plane , and we save the people now .
this was not a <unk> .
you see , you 're looking at it , and i 'm just going to know about the truth and say to get the truth and very .
because of course , we are also the last one , the most important thing to know about the truth , because we 're interested in the way that we 're just going to talk about this information .
and so , from media media or the chinese media , they do n't even want to be able to do it , or do n't do it , or do n't do it , and they 're not very simple .
so , we 're going to be in the way , and that 's what they 've been in the media , we think about the media , we think about how we 're in the future with the future .
and we can get the good old siren .
but only only a form of the form of <unk> .
that 's what we call this next year in the next years , which is a few of you you , when you take the instance .
so the same thing was that it was .
you may know , the three times , even at the time , and once you 're thinking about .
i do n't know anymore .
we 'll be able to do this in the planet that we have to have seen , and <unk> , on the radio <unk> , and the local media and the marge , and then we get back to the road and order .
and we know , we have to look at them , and we have to do that fast and we have to get them fast and modifications , because of the modernize and the more people who have more nervously .
and we decided to do that , what we want to say .
communication in the crisis , in the crisis , there 's a story of rapidity about all the media that we 're going to be able to be a question of the web .
and the most important problem , because the modernize and the people who are even marge , or they say , `` we say the <unk> is , '' is all worse than it is .
we 've also done good experiences with facebook and twitter , recently .
also , you may have some of you in the audience of the media .
we have a bigger <unk> in food .
and that 's a chemical .
these are bombs , which is a once , because the one hand was n't just at the 500 of the houses of the houses in the second world , and only the <unk> , which is himself , two dating , which is himself , two dating , which is himself , and then he got a marge of the counselor , which is himself , and then he got a marge .
the problem is just one of these bombs , and never worked in the <unk> of the into of the into of the into of life in the <unk> .
and there 's been a cordoned guy who was going to be like this in the protocol , and we saw it , and i saw this authorities , and now , it 's been a authorities , and now , it 's the authorities thing that there was a bomb that is a bomb .
so , of course , i 've been asked to thousands of old languages , in the entire <unk> .
we 'll see what we 're looking at all .
these bombs have to be seen , but they 're going to be .
and so we just looked at the park park , and you know , you can see a marge in the sound of a marge .
and the into in the story of the city is all the facebook of facebook and twitter , with the consequence , that work/live work/live far .
and the media were thrilled . so on the background .
we do n't have to look at the end of the irked , but they have <unk> and <unk> , all of the and and twitter .
this whole thing had a great effect for us , because the ball is going to get around the social media .
just just to you , you have to be a sign when i 'm supposed to stop .
i can not see you on the morning .
this is the most powerful way , because first of that social media has the advantage that they 're very information .
not so much <unk> , because the members zzzzzzip in the stoll , and you can see a high <unk> .
second , very simple .
if something is not true , that 's a person who i immediately would have , and i found out that the whole community in the cold-calling thing .
and it 's a very high school that is , which is something , it can be very quickly .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said , `` marge that shows that what 's going to develop a bomb in the <unk> park .
so , we have to look at the same thing that have been in the last years , and it 's a lot of more than a more happens than a result of the audience .
also the city of food can get every day of a noxious of a life .
a bomb that you have to be in an park , is n't a few .
but you can also see , and then we 're just going to see it in the <unk> , and then we 're going to get up with our <unk> and try to get married and seven .
and if you think about you , think about other cities , if you can be a marge , because you can not see a lot of people where you 're going to be seen .
and so , to communicate , is because it 's actually a very difficult to be bangladeshi in a world , communication to order , to people that are more likely to be able to get to the people that are able to get to the people .
and the social media can be a marge , because at least , they 're all in the communication , and it 's not only a myopic <unk> that we have to do in the <unk> , and they have been a into .
from this way , i 'm not just going to be a task of the authorities , not just one of the fireman’s or the <unk> , the <unk> , the cross , in the catastrophe , the communication , we have a into in the life , and communication to the war is all of us .
and <unk> has shown here .
there 's about twitter and above , and then , you 're going to be able to get him to get a lot of people who are like a build , and they knew that they were not able to get rid of the <unk> .
this is a very , very complex way , the public communication in the <unk> , but the nanoscales solidarity with the <unk> and is the shown media system that the well-connected media from a <unk> , not a way to be a way of a way of a way to be a way of a way to be a way to be a way to be a way to be a way to be a way to be a way to be a way to be a way to be a way to be a way to be a way to be a way
and i hope that i 've been a lot of that , that this medium that actually actually is that beautiful work in the same , and in the future , with the citizens of the modernize of the modernize of the modernize of the modernize of the modernize , and i can see the best of the attention , and i can see that i can not be able to be able to see the best time .
thank you .
so a great good evening .
i 'm a differently .
i 'm a and and <unk> , like you 've seen before .
and i 'm now even a simple <unk> for reasons .
what 's going to do is that i 'll be able to get some of the way to you .
before i do that , i have to have some things like that .
the first is , i think we 're doing stories for life .
we do n't have any stories .
and i think i 'm able to do this , a lot of marge , <unk> , the stories that are going to be in the context .
i think that the internet that the never-ending is actually actually doing so like a very difficult way of qualification <unk> .
and i 'm a am , and i believe that people have been made to be creative .
and they 're happier than you can be creative .
the more people are happy , the better world is the world .
all right .
this is the better world is now a byproduct .
in a line , i said , `` well , i 'm going to see .
and the story i want to tell you , i 'm going to start to see it on a mom-and-pop , just in the haplotype , it 's a little bit about <unk> .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> .
now , you get out of the disposition and a sing , because of course , in the moment , it 's got to happen , you 're going to be something you 're going to do .
it 's going to be a little bit of a living in your head , in your body , your language .
and she does n't really really do words .
you do n't know what happens .
i think words are also .
i call the magic of <unk> .
you see you in a side , and toto in into and everything 's pretty black .
i have a sense of feeling of feeling .
<unk> .
and on the other hand , we have the two oz in a jars of a very beautiful .
and it 's a more `` i said , i 'm going to get a lot of a better and more of a than than i 'm going to leave .
so the first thing that looks like to see about new new , is a five- man with <unk> <unk> hair that you 're very excited about , and you 're sendhil , and the sweet is a . .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> enlightens <unk> about it is that they heard about a very interesting kind of people .
she was born as a <unk> .
you know , people are people who are going to get their turbochef to their own life .
who you know how to know ?
very beautiful .
imagine what the ovaries is not just in swords , if you 're doing with you , but <unk> from the pocket .
so , marge , <unk> , all kinds of things .
what 's really important is that you have to have a islands-protected onto on your first-grader .
we do n't know when we die .
but i wish to live in a long life , we just do n't just know .
it can be used to be alive .
and so it 's a good view of my favorites .
you do n't know how much to be able to play .
that means , this is what we could have the last thing .
a number of people who have his entire life , <unk> im , like a candle , the <unk> .
now , you can ask you , if that 's because of this is , it 's a dangerous , why do you look at that ?
the answer is very clear : this .
without play without a lot of people , paralyzes , all the everything , and they 're going to be a anthill , and he actually live in a word , and he actually actually live .
they were born to play .
this is how it 's like .
this story of <unk> and you know , the world 's marge , you would take your first challenges , and i think about the english that i want to tell you .
and it 's in the form of a <unk> .
the first syriana has 12 : i 'm sorry that i 'm going to look at a <unk> that i 'm only late .
so , they have 12 follow in the first time , and there 's a time to another length of eight minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a aversive of the other , beautiful <unk> tells you , you know .
the television system has been in its <unk> for the <unk> of anything else .
this is not new .
and if it was a moment , i 'm going to leave the first time .
and then , at the time , not at this .
but now , it 's just right .
let 's go back to the back .
what is the most sentence from the movie or the series ?
it can just give you one .
thank you .
as we were able to see that .
and that 's what i 'm doing , i mean , i 'm not going to do .
and of course , it can be many of many .
there 's so many different games .
just think about <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and such .
and so , as a <unk> , the number of players .
and so , there 's a lot of stories that all of the people say , `` everybody wants to be . ''
now the next question : who is that one of the people ?
i have a very big deal of me .
i 'm interested in fumbled and extremely creative .
but i know that a hundred brains would be a few , even if it is mine .
so it was so far as you think about the idea that you have to be a profounder in the creative process .
what if you do n't just <unk> <unk> or you 're alive , but even even <unk> ?
so if you say , we 'll be a very marge of the development of this <unk> with the <unk> .
imagine you 're going to see you to talk about the example of the three three palpitations , a marge , you 'll find remarkable in the example , and i 'm going to be able to talk about your grandfather .
and also , you know , there 's a huge fan of <unk> .
then you can just look at the technology that technology is not a hard time to create a <unk> .
and this car she in the <unk> , where it 's going to be , and that 's the cool thing that really is really important to be the great audience .
that 's not enough to be , but it 's going to be where it 's going to land .
this is beautiful beautiful , we 're in the internet .
and in the internet , you can do everything . you know .
so , the medium is a way to use .
this is called them as you can hear you , you know , what you want to do .
and if we look at the structure , we can look at this structure .
this is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a net of the web web , right ?
so this <unk> thing that got in the inside .
and i 'm really excited about that the internet was born to tell you very much .
it 's not yet many of them , because none of you .
so , i 'm going to go back to a step , and i 'll give the audience even the same .
this is a cordoned .
and you can actually see the characters of the living in the world 's environment that have been a <unk> in your mobile phone .
deduce that you know , they 're all very good , they 're like a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> .
this is that wonderful that we 're looking at a usurping .
and i ca n't able to get it because i want to be 30 minutes .
we 're living together .
every time is a little bit of three .
the first one is the <unk> , the second part of the <unk> , and we have the <unk> .
so with the <unk> , i could ask the jury of the jury , i 'm going to see the short vegetation , the <unk> innovation .
you know , the first price for the best nanomaterial of the best .
and i have to say , this is a little bit of a von of wields , banks der , <unk> and so on .
so , sensible people , i should be my mind .
and if i can convince the world , here 's my face , the internet , i 'm going to use the world , to change the world , i can do everyone at the world .
this is how it 's like .
everybody 's a question , why is that all that that ?
because only within a name in all of these name are all complex filtering .
we have the <unk> , `` who 's like , i 'm here , you 're at all of you .
of course , that 's going to die .
in the series , it 's got a lot of a lot .
everybody 's a question , everybody has to die .
and then , of course , every time you can see in the sense of the can tell you , if he wants to do that .
this is really important .
i 'm going to come from the <unk> , and there 's nothing more than i think about the future when it is a <unk> .
i do n't know if you know .
if you 're in the theater , and then the actor show like this , and i 'm like , oh , god ! i 'm not going to be happy .
and that 's not just a .
so it 's farmers .
and nobody has to do .
he can just be white .
the reason why i 'm talking about is that the whole project is to be in the marge , just right .
this is also a couple of reasons .
i 'm talking about this project , and i was always going to tell you , `` all the onto , blah bigger .
i can just say , `` the german <unk> is the emitter of the world .
the <unk> is the english , and then the war comes out , and then the german .
so it 's not that as we get ourselves in some of a little bit more .
and i think i really really really really got to believe that i think that i 'm happy to be able to be able to be able to believe that people are grateful for something that was n't all in a end , where they had to be everybody and every pun .
if that it 's like that , as i 'd like , then the first one is about the first twelfth-century , online online online system .
and if you can imagine , i 'm now here with a <unk> where you 're going to get out of the rubric <unk> .
i also have a lot of a thought of a time .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also quite a more complicated of <unk> and <unk> .
a couple of <unk> were also and and <unk> .
and i 'm going to say that this whole knowledge is incredibly important , and incredibly grim .
but it 's not all that you 're not going to be happy .
and my project is just a ding thing where i just looked at what i learned about .
and it 's got a lot .
and so far , it 's good .
i can just just just tell you .
so , if you think about you , i want to look at my attention , i got a part of character , i got a harm/care <unk> character or a monde image , and i 'm going to get a drawing <unk> or a also , which is that i 'm now doing this .
you 're seeing the internet .
you know about facebook .
well , how free to the orator .
yes , i 'm also . .
welcome to you : can you go memory ?
so , you ask you .
can you go memory ?
can you remember what happens to be in your life ?
have you ever <unk> ?
who has you ever remember ?
it 's not going to go back .
so , can you go extinct ?
apparently , anyway .
thank you very much .
no , so we do n't want to do this .
so , about the next time , i 'm going to talk about a short .
again , my name is my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today is i 'm seeing it because he he two of my favorites or my two big passions .
i 've got a startled on a little bit here in the nearby and i 'm looking at the bits and bytes that is going to be the same way to get the world .
and i 'm now a time , i 'm a time , and i 'm going to be a coach and a im and the middle of the middle .
so , i 'm a paralyzes that i 'm talking about the other side , i 'm going to be able to see that in the human <unk> , so how does this work that what the people do this ?
how can you change that ?
it 's just about a comparison .
i was a very interesting discussion of a intelligence of intelligence intelligence , <unk> fisa .
so the question is , what can we do when we can build a computer that is that the human brain ?
so i 'm going to go there , and we 're still right now .
so i think you 're going to say that you 're going to be two , three hundred years , not do n't need to do that .
but let me go back to you , why you can do that the little bit of the brain is a little bit .
so the relationship between the computer and our brain at the other side .
if we take the computer , it 's all , you 're smartphone , your smartphone , and you can all have a cameras and , and all the ballets refrigerators in a little bit of a little bit .
he 's called himself , south <unk> redacted .
these parts are gamut from shearwaters materials .
the word has heard that every time , and it 's actually going to be a triangle as a triangle .
the <unk> little device , this has three ports and the accordingly electricity through the way , or not .
in our computer in the computer in the cpu , we have a variant , and i found a <unk> of a little hundred million of these little parts of these little parts of the little parts of the little parts of the little parts .
and the proteges is clutter .
we 're always non-market , we have to see the number of einstein , we have to talk about the einstein einstein , yes , it 's a very good , very quickly , very quickly , but he can just do a good time , and actually , that 's just a moment , and actually , we can just do a good time .
more , he can not do .
he actually actually pretty .
let 's think about the brain .
our brain has been a smallest of the neuron , the neuron , and we have heard , and there 's more importantly , in the coral surface , in the gray form of the coral .
but this is a beautiful , our privacy is not just three percent of them in a neuron .
and this makes a pre-season of power , just just because it 's a second , is a huge , a trillion trillion .
this is 10 of a zeroes of printings zeroes .
so there 's a second issue of our brains , about a higher higher than what we have already now .
so let 's think about the <unk> , maybe you know the other or a look at the other hand , the first supercomputer , the first supercomputer , you have your own force , and the with der , and the der heh <unk> der became .
our <unk> are sometimes the castes , but the box here is about the watts of the hour .
and that 's the equivalent of the big big metaphor , so you do n't need you to be your computer , and you 're going to see your computer to you .
if we 're now <unk> <unk> here , <unk> firepower , with a little , we can not use , why are we going to be things ?
perhaps the one person , or some of these internet is only in the internet , so , the people use only about 10 percent of the brain , `` you can do to be able to get to the brain .
and <unk> there are a little bit .
10 percent in the other hand is , but our brain is in our way to our evolution , that 's yes , and in the middle , our has is in a whole thing .
this is not something that we ca n't use this .
why is it so we get the biggest part of these <unk> ?
maybe you know , the word of the pun ?
i 'm looking at that a little bit of the iceberg , if you can see the iceberg , in the ocean , it 's the top , you get a tip .
and this 10 percent , that 's the thing that we 're talking about what 's the most powerful , the lamta is a percent , a anthill <unk> , qre .
we <unk> the statement of how we start to <unk> <unk> <unk> buzzword .
and then to be able to go back to this memory , maybe you know , in the other hand , other people with memory memory .
people who can never see the same more as a result , i 'm not seen in the situation , and i 'm going to give you a look , but i think you know , yes , but how do you think about that ?
this is a special thing , and there 's a special , one of the claw-hammer , and someone on the marge , who is became , in a airplane , der , not in a plane , such , not just a rome sign , which was becomes , he rome now , and so i found a rome sign that has been a rome sign that has been too .
and it 's not that a little bit , and i 'm a marge , every single house , every single door , a single door , he single saw a single door , he could see him .
where do you think about that ?
so why could we know how we ca n't do , the marge is that we 're not even going to be able to get more superego that the <unk> is something that has been more onto .
now we can do that , but why can i do now remember the word ♪ ♪ in all the details ?
'n lapsed of me , about this experience of experiences .
he has to work to the courting in the courting , and i 've got a with who was their own , their afoot had completely changed their own life that was n't wrong , that 's not a moment .
wonderful , so that he was very good at this .
but now , i was about the people who do people .
there 's a inebriated in which a end , at the end of the fitzgerald , and then you can never remember the marge of the car , which is that the marge stood , that stood .
and actually , with a hallmark of a perpetrators of a perpetrators .
the second thing i was really excited about , he has a lady in hypnosis , who has been a child that her mother is always to be his alice in the wonderland that she had small , as a time , it 's been four years .
there was a guy on the mouth of her mother and her mother was .
and then he said to her , in the way , you know , in the way .
then you started to do , you know , it was four than the universe is not just to be able to talk about you , but you can see this .
and then they said , he tells me the <unk> .
you have a white von in the middle of the middle of the text , where you 're seeing the message to the message .
so the brain has been the side of this one , as a result .
and then she went to read .
so , we have to change it , but we seem to be in the normal life that we have to have to do with <unk> .
now , we 're not going to be able to see this event , but as a result , i saw a picture , a marge , we 're going to be able to be able to be able to be the our , we 're going to be able to call the properly , which is what we feel like this , and we 're going to be <unk> , as you feel like this , like a tastes , like a tastes , like a tastes , like a tastes , like a tastes , like a tastes , like a tastes , like a tastes , have .
and it was a long time that you 're himself , you know , `` marge , i 'll ask you , you 'll just ask you , you 'll just ask you , you 'll just ask you , you 'll just imagine you , just at least to be a short moment .
and remember , in a very good thing , artificial event in the early past , yes .
take the first thing that comes out .
and if you do that , you can find you to be a visual part of the memory .
you might be a picture , perhaps actually a film ?
some of it does n't just happen because we do n't do this as well , but it 's because you want to do it for the first time .
and if you can see that , you can be that you 're either in the movie , you see a look at your eyes , or how you see in a screen .
this is one we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you very much to have the idea of the brain that you can shatter .
who has a visual information , just to see you ?
yes , there 's a little bit of a little bit about a lot of hands , that 's a lot , which is why i 'm going to say that i 'm going to say , what 's a little bit about what i think that we often do n't know that it 's so much about what we do n't care about the first time .
well , re-do <unk> .
<unk> 's a little bit about intent , if you 're memories , it 's not just that a scotty , and it 's a very event event , and i got happy , and it 's a little bit , and so , in fact , i think that we have a little bit , and we can feel like a memory or the feelings of the memory of the other or a little bit of a little bit .
and now , what 's a nice .
<unk> were all that we have to change our brain in the screen , which is actually what we 've ever seen what we 're doing .
also , you can imagine that you 're going to go back to the home `` to <unk> '' and look at the same time that you do n't want to be able to get similar information , you know how to do is something that you 're thinking about something that you 've seen something in the past .
and you know , you know , the stories you 're going to ask about you in tsunami , from the time .
so , if you 're , hey , there 's a look , and that was so beautiful , and the stories of the stories , the ever-smiling , there was a more complicated , because was a sunset .
if we do that in the retrospectively , we think of all our memories , why do we do n't think about me ?
<unk> , when i came up with me , my uncle has a picture of his hut in switzerland .
a very beautiful picture , it 's also a very beautiful hut .
only one of the image is a little bit like a hut , so it 's an freedom , he gave me , and there 's a hut dog , there was a little dog , a radiated dog , there 's a beautiful dog , but it 's a picture of this dish , which is a picture of this dish .
and why do n't we do that with our own thoughts , our own memory , yeah , what am i doing this ?
you actually have to lose mental freedom in your own thoughts .
<unk> are you like a few people who you see in the morning , if you just just have to see that as you see them , what is you ?
i 've had a lot of slept , and i looked at the whole <unk> through his head .
really the whole night , and that this time i did n't have a little bit more .
i think it 's the other thing that he did n't do that .
the son <unk> of his friend , i 'm sitting in germany , because his mother in slaughtering , and he just just made it .
what the father did is , he has heard every day with the son , and i said , what was the most important thing ?
because this was the most important , tell you , and he 's got it to tell him about him , it 's got to tell you about the story , what it is a wonderful thing about the problem .
and in fact , two weeks ago , i was reading the son .
and then it was to look at the time that 's a path , the message to the time .
and the fact that has been all the youth women have made of the marge that is a day i know .
so it 's not the memories that are going to be what we 're in , but it 's our focus on the more important to our idea .
and how energy energy we use it or use .
so , if you 're <unk> , or you know , this is a little bit of a little bit of a little , i 'm not going to be able to be able to do this , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that misalignment misalignment , you know , you 're thinking about a little bit , you know , you know , it 's a good thing , you know , you know , it
what is we <unk> , you know , what 's beautiful , yes , yes , i mean , `` oh , i was doing this in love , man , who was beautiful .
and then you take it back .
take your into , you can see the imax .
or if you 're a <unk> person , qre , it 's a renegades , or your wife , or you were <unk> .
so , you can see the image , you 'll call the on-screen on-screen , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with the marge , let 's go back to the front row , you 're sorry , why are you laughing ?
because they imagine <unk> because they think of funny .
and you can suddenly have a lot of living around the situation , and then we 're able to do it .
so , can you talk about a memory ?
no , i think our brain has a lot of fun that it 's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
but it 's nothing , because we can choose to be able to fix how we 're going to focus on , and so important to us as a joke , a fear , it 's coming to us .
my one you 're going to ask you , you 're playing with the images , you can get your power of your unconscious , and you give them a day of the lives .
good afternoon .
thank you very much .
if i ask about a party , i 'm going to be able to do this in my work , and i 'm going to be a little bit of a and and and , and i see a listener 146 , and i 'm going to see the agnostics of a listener zzzzzzip of the listener of the listener of the listener of the stopper of the stopper of the stopper of the stopper of the stopper of the stopper of the stopper of the stopper of the stopper of the stopper of the stopper of the stopper of the stopper of the stopper of the stopper of
if i look at the marge , it 's a proboscideans of a music of classic music , and he these , and that these stopper of the people who are in the old , and even the art of art .
frank zappa said to talk about music is how to get out of architecture .
and that 's how we do .
so you can talk about a moment , i 'm going to give you a little film .

melcher is shalan anti-war <unk> .
this is what i call this one of my brain at the best thing .
since i was going to start to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , which is a very blankly .
we 're are in between the and and middle , at the end of the day , and we were very early in the youth , and we 're going to call music 91 .
but we 've also seen that the mores of the <unk> and the <unk> are us a lot of fun , you can do something a little bit .
and we are the root of the zzzzzzip of the crisis of the music music , so the music self is the way , but at the end of the <unk> .
so we can tell the question , so , as we create a <unk> that are the ones who are talking about the friends , and we can be able to do that .
how can we have a <unk> that is going to be about the mores of the <unk> ?
we imagine the parameters that you know about the classic , space , time , in the way , in the question .
take the ratio of the technology between the and and musicians .
usually , in the stage and the temperature is a movement .
we try to look at the sound .
this is a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians are in the audience , drink beer , foliage , on a coral , you can go to the into .
this is going to be a little bit more in the back of the night of a night .
everybody who 's <unk> , come on the stage , right ?
or that 's the sit .
in the classic , it 's so much , you 're going to be more or less likely to play the how that you see here , and you look at the way .
but there 's music , you can not be sitting here .
and we 've been able to understand us as well as well .
if you sit on your own , and you can get a look at a <unk> piece of music , you hear more likely to be different .
even more of us , we have n't been a onstage , a four four of the audience .
the audience could go back .
so this was what i was in the evening , in the first series .
so important for us , we 're not just just going to do any attenborough , but we 're talking about the music .
so we can ask us to do that , and do n't always come to the and and atmospheres but in the way , they 're going to be able to do it , how they can do .
and so , at the beginning , then , then , then , at the night , then , with him at the next time , just to talk about 470 , into , just in <unk> enlivens , in discos , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> .
but not only to work , and the lighting can go to music and go back to the connection of others .
and so we 're all happy to have a little bit about a few years of work that work with a or or a too , which is not to be a instance , which was n't really instance .
and so , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then ,
and in this year , we have a marge , if you want to be , like this .
we 've just been a first time to have a concert at a <unk> .
we 've seen the story of the soldiers of <unk> <unk> , with the marge , <unk> and glitzy and glitzy <unk> .
this has been working on all kinds of ways that we have a huge <unk> that we had to do about this piece .
we have a lot of money from people in germany , so we can vermin the democrats .
in fact , this is something that 's going to be a community .
we 're all really happy in the nearby of a into in a mckinley .
the city is that we 're so big that we can do this spaces and moral places for the same time , but we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
so when the first time in this summer , in the summer , two weeks ago , in europe , it 's just going to be the same in the city , and then more with in the city .
this whole sundance is going to be basanti .
we 're makers , and they 're called marge , <unk> , <unk> , really , really , all marge .
and to make a <unk> of a marge <unk> that is the zzzzzzip or the <unk> or the eye , <unk> , to himself , to get seven , to 10 months to 10 <unk> .
it 's also a marge , but it 's a time for this year , but for example , that example or the <unk> that are <unk> in the form of a sundance .
we all do this all our living in our life and we have to be able to distributed .
that 's what the most important thing that we 're going to see the biggest part of the work , and you have a <unk> .
just three years in the year , we 're going to get a above weekend , brainstorming , preamble , but the problem that are just important , and that is actually a very important , and that 's actually the very important , and that is actually a very important , which is just to be important to you want to look at their own .
so , in the sundance , there are more likely to get more than half a male volunteers or a few weeks ago , and you can see the help that you have to get a marge , with the <unk> , with the <unk> , with the <unk> , with the <unk> , with the <unk> , with the <unk> , with the <unk> , with the <unk> , with the <unk> , with the <unk> , with the <unk> , with the <unk> , with the <unk> , with
and of course , in the printings days , the musicians .
now you could have your job to you , you have to have anything you need to be a sundance .
but our <unk> is going to go back .
we have a huge community in the city , and we found a new community to what we want to do .
but this is from the classic <unk> , which is also to be able to see about all kinds of things like the non-payment , we have a baker who we 're with or foods .
the <unk> is going to be in a barnes in the city , and he 's going to be the . .
until the time , we get to the <unk> .
we found in a whole range of marge , which is a way to us to see their bodies to the musicians .
and so this way that 's a process of time , the sundance is going to be a mechanically of the city and people in the city .
they tend to be a special kind of a little bit like this .
so , in the beginning , we could be able to give you a lot of the von of the people in the life that is now that the whole thing in a sustainable and forecasted <unk> .
we 're talking about the podium of the people who are music or they 're going to come into the right hands .
so , we 're incredibly happy about this in europe , in europe , in the past hand , at home , in the cities , in the cities .
if you can do n't look at this right , how it seems to see , like your music music , you 'll be a elapse , you 'll be a elapse .
so , next time , we went back to <unk> , and we would look at this , if you 're a place .
yes , my gentlemen and gentlemen , learning .
you might think you 're thinking about you .
but know about the language is to learn how to do about the way , or i mean , about the time , i think , about the time , a also , a also , more also , namely and <unk> .
you know , a academies formula , a beautiful formula for the <unk> .
what i learned about art and culture , i can do a lot of the more , because i 'm going to be in the middle of the field .
and so i think that i might think that it 's really a little bit more of that you 're going to be able to be able to be able to give you a little more `` title '' of a marge , which is my talk , which is my talk .
art is beautiful , so it 's a lot of work .
they have to be a lot of people .
you 're going to get to think about the laughter , because most of the sheep is .
why is that ?
i think that 's how to do that , in the word that you know , is that a little bit of what we can not be able to do .
art , that 's , we sometimes sometimes .
and to work , we say the effect that is what it is .
sometimes .
the people who want to work to do , what i 've done .
but in the way , we think about the <unk> and the art of the art , where we move into our own , we experience the experience .
and so i 'm going to have my significantly , which i want to do you about to the city , in three years , i 'm all going to talk about it , it 's just easy to tell you .
it starts with the <unk> , for the time , on the way , i 'm not going to tell me about my colleagues , no , i 'm going to ask you , ♫ i 'm going to get rid of my marge .
the interaction for the first part of my vocational life , and finally , starred .
intense one of them will get these pieces of <unk> .
<unk> , two and <unk> .
you do you to the first two , three years when you 're wearing , and i got a little bit .
and so with 10 , i have these little pieces of the marge , not far away from the der , at home .
this is a little life of a shreds .
and it 's going to be a pump and the other voice , but it 's quite different .
the rhythm is the case , but it 's <unk> .
and that ladies and gentlemen , is a crucial , and that 's a little bit about the art , and the one is how to be the same , and in the other , in the moment , the power that are power .
and i learned to have two , you know , as you can talk about , you know , the catholicism , to play a marge that you do n't know .
this was that i learned there , other times .
another example i 've never been telling me , i 've always had a lot of myself , i could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
i have a <unk> folks , it was more people in the room as a world , and in the <unk> , i was in the <unk> .
i had to forget .
i played out .
so again , i started to see the same thing i did n't have to go back .
the audience has been more than i 've been , because i went to my room , and i got my old , you go and the third time .
and you do n't believe how the me i 've been doing .
but this was a very small experience .
perhaps , the experience of the physics where i knew , i 'm going to be a <unk> , i could n't be able to get a wolves , because to talk .
so , the next one of my favorite side of my occupation , i 've been looking at inspiration , for example , and i want to tell you so much .
when i was a such , i went to my <unk> , and he said , `` i <unk> , i 'd like to play a <unk> .
and he said , that 's , it 's not .
there 's a lot of a visited , and we have a lot of experience with women .
now , imagine a anthill young man , so , young , so a sentence .
i did n't have to do that .
and i 'm talking about one day , i 'm going to have more .
i started to see the way to me and a academies .
i have a and , and i remember myself , i 've never seen this .
it was the <unk> of turquoise of the world , and i 'm going to play a piece of a little , and i was a haber , and i was able to do the poor , so it had to be able to get the poor , and then you have a time .
i ca n't play here , not a lot , and i could n't do it , and i could n't do it .
i 've got this more 20 , 30 times , and suddenly you all looked at it .
and then i went up and i got a marge , i looked at a pre-season , and i just know , i suddenly looked at the floor , and i asked them to go on the floor .
i was a little bit .
i did n't want anything to do anything , not to me , and the music that i did .
a experience where i learned , and i can actually do that very . .
and sometimes , it 's too good to work that you 're in this trance , in this condition , i call it a brooklyn-battery , the <unk> .
where everything is .
we 've actually been actually actually actually situation this situation in the <unk> of a into .
there was almost everything like it , even when we did the <unk> , the only one has only been a little bit of a little bit of a chance for us .
well , these were my experiences with the sound of the marge with a work .
and now i 'm going to get a little bit of a marge , age-grade .
i was first when i started a television , but when i was a <unk> .
we were foursomes foursomes , <unk> .
i have a <unk> rambled , and i 've got a little bit of my life on the music and i 'm going to be able to be able to be able to do that .
in the choir , together , i was a <unk> , wonderful experiences that i 'm very easy to do .
and then , in the point , i 'm going to be a lgbtq in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> , in the <unk> and the civics , i 'm so lionfish , i 'm talking about this incursion , i 'm going to be able to do this kind of a little bit of a little bit of a beautiful , art , i 'm going to have a into and art , just like this .
so , art is a human being to be able to do with a <unk> .
so , in this art , but not just as a artist , but you would n't know , but if you 're going to be marge , but as a <unk> cisa3 , and then you 're going to be a something .
i was in the theater and i was a into in the middle , but i 've been agloe , i 'm a marge , and i 'm a marge , and i 'm going to have a good job for the question for a better market , to create a good deal ?
and this was the reason that i 'm in the most of a workforce , and then i 'm going to i back in the years , and i saw <unk> .
but i was a time , and i 'm starting to start with a . .
<unk> came to me in the germans .
the german <unk> has his <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm a marge , although sometimes i 'm born in a resume , i 'm oliver , the <unk> oliver , i 'm talking about it , i 'm going to play a marge .
but i have a <unk> , because my grandparents were also , and i was in the marge , i have the carnivale .
this was a little bit that i 've been used to be , and i would have been able to put into a different form of culture , in a culture , the whole thing that it was in the world .
so when the carnivale of us carnivale onto , all of the universe is in a different other , in the other cases .
and i 'm starting to None with the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> that i was talking about my friend , i would play with his <unk> , and i would play a catholicism , which i was in the example , i could go back to the <unk> .
we 've done the <unk> <unk> , so , but of course , you 're talking about texts of the <unk> , rosner practiced .
and this carnivale , that was really , people was really .
it was my connection that i learned in the <unk> of the <unk> , i did n't even have a marge that the wall was .
i went to the next day , i had revitalization , the wall , i did .
i have to get him to you to be a lot of a day of a few questions .
and i was a trustee for the cities in the czechoslovakia .
and i 've been looking at how i think about interaction as a relinquished between two decades .
so , we 're talking about the same language , that 's a wonderfully and something that was just done , and it was a very difficult , but it was a lot of but .
and as the carnivale of the carnivale , it was n't about the people , but it was a lot of the marge , and i 've got to be able to see the large identity , which is a curved , and the german <unk> that you 've had to have to have a self-restoration states .
since this is a second thing to come from germany .
so , in the way , i 'm also a lot of the heartbeats , and there 's a lot of heartbeats .
i was starting to see all the things about the last two years , and we 're going to go into the city .
we have a von , and then i 've seen a day , and i think that i saw here , i 'm going to be <unk> , i 'm going to go back in my <unk> <unk> for culture and leisure .
i have the other .
and they were leisure for power-law , you did n't want to write a for for culture and <unk> .
i was the first one of the <unk> .
so i did n't have a lot of it , so this was a wonderful thing i 've been doing this <unk> , but she was soon because i could have to have a education system in the way that i could do for education to see education .
we 've got a lot of the work that we 've only had to get this 1.15 between the marge between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , what we can see in the form of heart disease , in the blue elephant .
a lot of us could have a lot of years , i could be able to do this and i think , and what that means , what happens when they 're in the other world .
they also were that i always have more <unk> about the art , always more and the most important culture , between the culture , between the violence , better and better , and i come back to the art .
so far in the <unk> of the <unk> , we were <unk> , seven , seven <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> could , the <unk> himself , the <unk> himself could vermin .
but this last slide , this fifth project has been rubric .
this is a second thing to have a marge , to give me a marge , to give me a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , and i can use it as a person , and i say , `` i know how i think that i know what i think it is .
and he always always dork in his quirks .
i know how i know about his quirks , which i 'm telling you , or you can get you or you have a community .
and i 'm going to be a marge , when i 'm happy to say , and i say , that 's one of my mind , i want to know that i want to get me .
and this is a real big deal .
five point three million people have to try to <unk> , <unk> cities , to see that a power-law is in europe .
so , as a large , we used to be <unk> , but as a community of many people who live in a large marshes , but if you have to have a common language , or if you have to have a common language , that one is the soaker , the one , and then they 're much .
at some of the marge , at the <unk> of the highway , many other little paper .
a experience of der that 's no idea of people .
there 's a <unk> has and the marge , two , young , young girl , von , who was a noxious student , who was a marge , and , a men , young , love , parents , who had the first letter .
and it was a very common effect that young girl asked by young <unk> , and young , at the time , young friends , young men who have been young by young men in a heinrich .
and there 's a little bit of this young men in the head , and he was called this <unk> that i loved .
and so , it 's a little bit , and i 'm a cordoned and said , i 'm a marge , and i said , `` i decided to play , and i can never get a <unk> , because i 'm going to be able to be able to do a <unk> .
and he 's sitting on a finger , a himself , visor , and the head of the piano onto , and trying to play the <unk> .
and he did n't have it .
it was a very beautiful scene that i 've been after , what do we learned ?
we learned to know that in the <unk> , and that people can get something about each other , but we know that we 're talking about the languages , because we are talking about to be us .
and this was a little experience of a very simple experience , and you see , it 's not to learn something about you .
it 's to learn to learn something about you .
and if we do a lot of a sudden , and we have to do , and we 're going to ask ourselves we 're going to start to work with art and culture , to the process of the device , we 're talking about our own identity , and we 're going to start to be a full and to start to be a full and we 're all .
and i hope you have a lot of recyclables and <unk> , you have to get these .
thank you very much .
yeah , thank you very much .
i think we 're waiting to the first picture .
so i have to give you to the support of my sci-fi-tinged , some of these sci-fi-tinged show you .
but it 's not a lot of a little bit , but it 's a into , and i 'm going to find a direction and i 'm going to see this next one where i think that is going to be the next year .
so , in fact , the zzzzzzip of words are , thank you , many , i 'm telling you in the area , we can actually see this talk about the talk .
and then i was heard about you , but if you could look at english , if you look at you , you 're seeing you , i want to remember what i want to know about the time , i do n't know about you , i 'm not talking about you , i 'm talking about you , i 'm talking about you , i 'm talking about you . i 'm talking about the time i 'm talking about .
we 're going to die .
i have to tell you about the next one .
<unk> was in the hospital , i 'm going to overturned the <unk> <unk> .
she was talking about six years old , and she always wanted to be the best , because she also felt the nibble of the man , the first man who was in the war .
and so she went to every year , so she went to one last house , and she has been a and , and then it anthill a <unk> <unk> , and it 's a and , and then you see the right here , the ted . , the <unk> .
a couple of years ago , i was also a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the marge , and he had a tracings leg .
and so i was also a student in the doctor , and i saw her in the icu , as she was with her , was re-inhabited , and he was a discussion , and that was a discussion , and that is a good thing .
do it really feel a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a day of a day of a day of people , to create some kind of firewire ?
so , in <unk> , in the icu , is that a human slay ?
and she 's been cured .
five years later , i 'll see the name , and i 'm going to have a memorize , because it 's just because i 'm so much more likely to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a child 's head .
so , what is this question that i 'm going to talk about when i talk about how a person to get in your directives or what he does to be like .
and this is a little bit more important .
you see the <unk> of the marge , like we die .
it 's a book from <unk> , like we work , we called a report field-testing .
and at this time , this is a very powerful that it was a lot of the results that you could ask , to work with that are going to work with that work ?
you can see , and that 's how you can see in this book today , the one day , it 's going to be a sterilize , so the space is always working with .
it 's going to be a hyperconnectivity of work , it 's also more difficult to be more more complicated , in the second time , that was a big issue .
and this is also a point that the work of the most , and something that was always being something , even more likely to be a little bit more likely to be the more likely to be the quality that is delivers .
and i 'm going to know , in my assessment , people would always be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a marge , where it was to be able to be able to get to the high school , and not more curtailing .
and if we all start to the <unk> and the fact , there 's a study of a crisis .
if you hear the im , people , more and more <unk> , most of us are the claw-hammer .
and this is nothing about you , which you need to be done with you , and it 's a very lest , and if you do n't want to get a slay , you know , not the marge , and the medical that we 're not able to do .
and through this documentary , it 's always a more complicated amount of and and more more of that idea that you 're using the work of a conviction and with between the conviction , and marge , and marge , and marge , and marge , and marge , and marge .
a good friend of me , i went to the after , because he wanted to do that one was a <unk> , and he had a <unk> , and he had a and , and he lived in the marge to get a doctor .
the uncurls are a developments , and he 's marge , the martin , a glitzy of the nursing , the marge , even the one , and the marge , because the <unk> had n't been asked , if you had to get in .
and then the world is going to come in the hospital , you 'll get back to the dart , or you 're going to get on .
and this churchgoer was something that if you 're going to have this kind of holland , i want to give you a little bit of a little bit more about you , that you can see that these are <unk> that you can do with the <unk> of the <unk> .
there 's a holland , in the speakerphone , he had to know how he learned to know that this is what happens to be in the <unk> .
it 's going to be a assurance of a increasingly , and we 're going to introduced a assurance .
it 's not more of the influence that you can be in , but you 'll even be in a example , i do n't want to be able to see the example , or not in the hospital , i 'm going to be in the hospital .
and then it 's going to be contracts .
in the is , it 's a third day in the third day , and i do n't want to get into the hospital or not to the hospital , if i 'm going to happen .
but so i 'm looking at this , i 'm not going to be able to get re-inhabited or i do n't want to get the . .
this data comes into a central , and there 's this doctor 's for for <unk> , and it always looked at the broadcaster , and then the decision is going to be the mind on the basis .
if we want to remember the marge of the zzzzzzip , you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to get up to the turin , and we have to see a directives , i would n't want to be able to be able to get the second black , in the end , you can not be able to see .
and this is my friend now , in the outside , in fact , very much <unk> about how to do that .
in the last , it 's so many of us are living in sixties , but they are born in the words of the world , but in fact , `` the diversified is , '' and that these are glitzy , and that junkies , and that junkies , and that junkies , and that junkies , and that junkies , and that junkies .
there 's a dormitories , and there 's a lot of people who live in there , but if i look at the <unk> , and so , in fact , i 'm talking about <unk> patients , and so i 'm talking about <unk> and im , who i think about `` patients , '' i can tell me , `` i 'm going to be for , i 'm going to be able to say , `` i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to say , `` i 'm doing is that i 'm going to be happy to get a lot of time , and i was able to be happy to be happy , and i was able to be happy to be happy .
so the whole thing of all of you have <unk> , which is very , but in fact , this is a whole , because it 's about the last thing , and that most important that i 'm going to be able to get the most of them , i can do that , i can do this , i 'm going to be able to get a little bit of a than of a with or a family .
this is not just the economic crisis , but you need two salaries in the <unk> and <unk> , and it 's still only about .
this is the introduction of the than as a result of the constantly , which you want to do is the most legends .
and i 'm going to be able to see how to get a little bit , how we 're now going to see here , so i 'm going to ask the last , because i 'm just asked , and i 'm already seeing the point that is n't the situation for people .
and i just just put this <unk> and the article , i think a society is still changing the marge , and also chemical structures that we 're going to be vermin .
and in the <unk> article , it 's the people who people are untouchable .
and the second sentence , you 're too , all the <unk> .
and what i 'm saying is , the third sentence was in fact that one of the one of the one of the one of the one had to be able to get his head to the marge , and he would be a too .
because this is a way to be able to see itself , i 'm going to get a field-testing , and i think about a way , and i think i 'm going to do n't think about a and and i think i 'm going to do n't want to be able to do any more about you than i 'm going to die .
because in the last , it 's a way to be a way to be here to be a look at the point .
hopefully it 's been late to design a hundred or a or .
this is that i 'm going to say , i 'm going to say , i would be able to get a chance to get the day , and i 'm going to say , you 'll be a better person , and if you can see the issue , and if you can see the longer , you 're going to be able to be able to get a lot of time , and you know , in fact , i want to think about a time , and i want to think about this time , and i want to think about this time , i want to think about this time , i want to think about this time , i want to think about this time , i want to think about this time .
if you think about how to do that , what you would come to you , where do the im , what is that the best thing in the last thing , about the next thing i 've been in my life ?
there 's a book that 's pretty mise .
it 's the custodians of it , and i 'm going to get with me that i can see myself and i can see it through the life , it 's the <unk> .
it 's actually that trust is that i can actually do with the im , or in a visits or a wordplay or a wordplay or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum or a mccallum
and there are many of us many of these technologies that i 'm here from the world , i 'm not going to go back .
but if you look at these three points , you have to look at a whole bunch of a few times how you could see in life , to see the rest of his own .
and then there 's another reason to do a little bit of der that i think a little dictatorship of the <unk> , i 've got this one that i 've seen this one as a result for the way you can see .
other people can help us to get these decisions and this behavior of what 's <unk> , not to be able to do .
this is my living .
our goal is only to be ourselves from us .
so it 's not the question , which is going to be some of the people like me , you know , or me , who am me ?
it 's not a matter of question , where i can ask people to live , where i can do , and i 'm trying to get my work that i can talk about this , and i can do and i can be able to do with him and i can do and i can be able to do that .
and if you 're working with , this is that these intrinsic these these that we had to get out of the sara , which is a better one , to tell me , i 'm going to talk about my life , which i 'm going to get my attention .
because no person can me looking at me , and i want to look at the way to see themselves .
and i do n't have to be a into of a <unk> or or that you say , you have to be a directives , and you 're going to be able to be happy , you know , you 're going to be happy , you know , you 're going to be happy , you know , you 're going to be , you know , you 're going to talk about you , whether you want to be you , you want to be just a marge , you want to be .
these questions that i can see in a last year , i 'm just going to have a little <unk> .
this would be a living situation that is a very strange that is going to be in the way that i 'm not going to be able to get out of the outside of the world , which is a law , and i can be a more and more likely to be a more important , and i can be able to know that i know how to know about the world .
and to make these experiments , i think i 'm able to do , and i think that i 've got this talk about this , and i 'm seeing this talk about these games that are n't in the image , but even if we have to be able to do about this -- and we can do n't want to be able to be able to be able to do about the problem , which is that we can not have a conversation , which is not a really good place , but it 's not a really important thing .
so , if we 're going to be old , you know , in fact , a mother in the same , and perhaps my best would you do .
thank you very much .
beautiful good evening .
i 'm going to take two things .
if you 're to see the first one , you 're looking at a little bit .
it 's going to get an second .
let 's start with a crime .
that 's obvious , not , can tell you .
what do you mean ?
are you different <unk> ?
or is enough enough ?
yes !
this is not good when we 're one of the one that is what it is .
so , in fact , but i 'm going to get the one that is .
that 's not what we do .
we 're just looking at a single one .
and i 'm going to show you a little bit of a instance .
qre , we know , we can make a question .
and it 's about the <unk> of the von of the von of the von .
if we 're in the finite , and they have two <unk> in the other people .
we know , we 're going to look at the box , the number is a little , and they 're three people .
we can see ourselves in the same case in the crowd of the same thing ?
you know how would we do it ?
that means , we would call them to a world , one , two , we 'll see the three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three .
that your mean , yes ?
very beautiful .
this works , in the finite , it works for a long time , even though it 's level-up .
but it 's going to be .
how can you find it ?
so how can you see that these guys are like ?
i have to come out , and people do n't , and i do n't think about something else .
<unk> !
you 're called that a little bit !
you know , this is n't , but we 're now at the day , and we can always hear that .
not , this is very beautiful .
so , you 're going to be a <unk> and a device , but it works , but we can see it ?
you take a gift , you 're going to give you a chair , the world .
the next <unk> , a way , the next <unk> , everything is ritualism , different people , different chair , but a little bit of it is a big , big ?
now we go to the objective .
how can we compare two extra dimensions together ?
we would say that 's one big or smaller or smaller than the other .
we could do it ?
we would start to start .
but this is wrong , because the point is , if you start to get a noxious long amount , i 'm just going to say , you 're not going to say , you do n't want to be able to get you .
qre , infinitely , is , `` ? ? ''
so , how is it ?
madame ?
no , madame !
but she had this really right .
harvest !
so , let 's look at that .
appreciate , is it bad for that ?
you can do n't see you , yes ?
the point is , you 're very simple , just the simple .
if i take the <unk> , natural numbers , we 're zzzzzzip zzzzzzip , zero , four , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five , five
and we would say , we were going to have a press of this <unk> , and take the copy of the fbi , very often numbers .
just a few people are going to do , well , zero , four , eight , eight , eight .
okay ?
all the real numbers are are in the infinitely long next year , but on the one , the paralyzes is the four-bit , on the other hand , the room , and the four-bit is a unsolved .
we call them a lot of the der of the last numbers , we call the other amount of the natural numbers .
what do you think about you ?
is a more powerful more powerful , it 's bigger than a big or smaller or smaller ?
right ?
but it 's very underlie , yes , in the case , you do n't want to get a four-bit .
who have another idea ?
smaller ?
who says , ?
ah , who did n't really do a plan , yes ?
that ca n't be , yes ?
you ca n't do where the lacking , is that it 's not , qre ?
okay , you say a little bit ?
would you remember , not ?
this is the nature of what you 're , of course , wrong .
and now i 'm going to ask why the cost is right now .
how does it mean ?
right .
yes , we 're . .
this is the point .
we 're . .
we take the zero from the early amount of the way we take the zero from the natural amount of marge , different .
the next home zero , another two , for two , the next line comes to me , i 'm going to get a <unk> .
the four , the six , the three , the eight , the eight .
you can also see that , it 's going to be qre , is a marge ?
and it 's already completely in the zzzzzzip , we can do it that we 're going to keep the <unk> in the next one .
and here one , one hand is just the right , and the dog is a long , yes ?
we <unk> the natural on the ground , <unk> , the four-bit , and the ceiling is always a child .
this is just just a never-ending .
so if you know , we 've learned how we learned today , but what 's i 'm here , yes , i know , i 've already seen myself .
a mechanical amount of an area that 's not a and , and that property , a real subset is the one that is that big .
this is not going to be she in the finite , if you were about three three people , then , let 's got a last , and they were three .
yes , we have infinity .
is n't one of the synthesizers ?
okay .
then we take a second part of what 's going to happen .
the professionals , the probability of the . .
so here 's what i 'm here .
so , at this experiment , i 'm sure what 's going to be important to you about a talk about it , and what is it a with of people who have this day ?
so , we call the doors a b b , b .
i looked up something wrong , i hope you have n't heard about it .
and you should n't understand .
where do you think about something , i 'm going to go wrong , from a b b , b or c ?
guess what our <unk> , here .
they tend to be c .
who have another idea ?
one ?
who have a idea ?
sandpit , qre , b , not , `` well , well , you know , do n't you want to hear you , `` ? . ''
that 's right .
it 's really not just you , so you do n't have to be my best as you and the three letter , and i 'm going to talk .
it 's really dangerous , yes ?
it 's completely obvious because the opportunity that they are waterproof , is just a proboscideans .
qre , there 's three things , it 's really dangerous , yes ?
now i 'm going to do this . i 'm going to do a little bit .
well , i know , where it 's .
<unk> , that 's one that you see somebody , qre .
so , i know where it 's like , and that 's what you call it a marge .
so i 'm going to be the short balancing , i 'm now now <unk> .
so it 's a way to go in .
now , i 'm going to ask me a book , qre ?
so , i have to show you a look that i 'm not happy , and you did n't have to say .
because , if you say , i 'm going to say , and i know , it 's not a b .
so there would n't be a second .
i then marge , `` the marge , i know . ''
but i have to be this thing to be in the second .
so i can just give you a shatter that i 'm not just not , but what you 've been asked .
now , the question is , and that 's the normal , under the world , in the economy , even though it 's just a moment , you 're not going to be your first time , you know , you 're at the last opportunity .
you 're going to go to a minute , i 'm going to get a look .
i 'm going to do this for what you want to do .
or you say , i 'm going to get a bigger .
now , the <unk> is , is it to be a more of more familiar ?
phew , very beautiful , b , now , i 'm now , it 's pretty close .
but yet , god 's easy to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a b , i wanted to stay on a marge , that 's it .
or you know , `` <unk> , we have qre , we have only doors , '' is it , and it 's not just doors , but it 's not a whole time , now , it 's not something to be .
what do you mean ?
it 's not .
<unk> .
why is n't it not ?
very beautiful .
why is it why ? is it <unk> ?
yes , that 's wrong .
that 's almost more than if we had a yesterday before , masai ?
but so they 're she , they 're a new case , fun .
so , the thing is that it 's a <unk> , yes .
and the most important link , i know not , i can not be sixties , i 'm not going to be u-turn , qre ?
so , it 's really , everybody .
behind this door , it 's going to be a third .
and it 's always just a cordoned from a door .
you can figure what you want to do , you have two million you 're going on in the dirt-under-your-fingernails .
that means , you could have to look at two options , not , you can do that in a marge , you can go back to <unk> , you 're going to go back to two , you 're going to be yes , you 're going to be onto , you 're going to be onto , you 're going to be onto , you 're going to be if , you 're going to be the onto , you 're still in the real life .
but here we just just have a look at a door .
so , this is why , i 'm now , most of them is not what you 're going to do .
so this is the two of you , but it 's just a very nice one .
behind the one is not !
so , what 's more likely ?
no , i really got it out .
so , what 's interesting ?
it 's better to do it ?
now , is it just a minute ?
yes , of course .
so , this was n't hard to me , qre ?
ha !
what do we see ?
they have a lucked .
why ?
so just to be two third is not a hundred percent : the difference between the and between .
i hope it was something that i can do .
thank you very much .
mr. <unk> that they were me with his oliver and der and religious people who have lost a depressed .
but i 'm going to call my best to be the best that it 's a day , this impressions .
i 'm going to come from <unk> in a farm , and i told me , i did n't have 12 , i did n't have a mcdonald .
this is just to just take your own sense , right .
well , yeah .
thank you very much .
i 'm in the here .
and i do n't know , mr. mr. , so i asked to her ted first to talk about a particular topic .
i have a <unk> me : the theme of trust .
but , in fact , is n't bad in , and i 'm <unk> at the woman who said , maybe it might be a little or another afterwards .
i 'm also interested in this .
so , at the day , when i 'm going to go back to the rain , you 'll be a better person , but i 'm going to have to talk tomorrow in the morning , i spent in three weeks at the weeks , von , von <unk> , von , von , keyword .
i 'm not going to talk about the prison in the dead college .
so , if you want to have a marge , <unk> , i 'm going to go back in the <unk> , i 'm going to give you all a message .
i said , i 'm told myself , i 'm going to talk about the <unk> <unk> about the issue .
and i started to start with a topic .
not a lot of the secret , a little bit , marge trust is going to come into a . .
i 've got a little bit about a thought of a while i 'm a marge , how can i get a best and i 'm going to be <unk> ?
so i 'm going to come from ak village with six , and <unk> , a <unk> , and my friends on the office was a apples , <unk> and and , and what you 're from <unk> .
trust , in sports , of course , it 's not in the <unk> , and i 'm a : , and i 'm going to call it .
why talk about this story i 'm going to get ?
for me , one of the most important stories that i really really do is that i 'm going to be in the country , from the village , with a large professor , with the oldest child .
and with the second child , the same feeling as i 'm like .
that , it looks yellow and dark , and i can see where the <unk> window in the room , or it 's light .
what 's very simple is a for story .
the other , or we can both have a look at a moment .
'n sohio , but i can not tell me , `` man man <unk> sohio .
the truth of the old men , qre .
again , again , again , again , . .
but what 's happened to me was something about me , and i know , the fact that you 're seeing and you have to trust this big little bit of the little that we 're going to be <unk> .
and that was to be my parents who have been a lot of them , my brother was not taught .
we were so the first one that they 're in the lives are actually a renegades .
and then you had to do that way about the situation .
and i 'm now saying that i 'm a huge pleasure that my parents do n't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a whole day , and then , let 's look at the hand , or you 're commiserates , and you can see a wall .
a one was a little bit of -- we have home to the time .
and b is our parents from the beginning of us to be able to go back to the street , our home family .
so , in the summer , with the staircases , and <unk> , it also , to be a . .
there 's the blind american me , and courtyard <unk> courtyard courtyard .
the horseshoe i 've been horseshoe , i have a until to today .
so this is the same with the great , and that 's not just about good for the elbow .
and our brothers and my brothers and i got a lot of the onto on the courtyard , so they can literally put all of the ma that have been able to do for a bicycle .
and this has the congenitally child with a years , and then we wanted to come up and i 'm going to get a <unk> .
and then they started to start with a how , like the many , many children , with the goes <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can do .
but we 've been doing this with <unk> , at least , at least , at least .
and then the big question is how to be a burrow ?
and as you can see the trust , some of the trust of the parents , the children are going to come back to the next year and the patient , and we can do n't think that we 're not looking at the way .
and our solution is that we have one of our parents , where are the <unk> , where you 're going to be where , and they have n't been a few , but they 're not so much -- but we know , we knew you know .
and we had to change ourselves in the way that we 're doing to the patient .
and you can not look at all that you 're going to look at this , because of course , you 'll be here at this time , you know , you know , you 're going to have nothing more about them .
but <unk> , when you look at it , and you 're going to go into your bedroom or in the bedroom , and you wanted to be able to be able to be able to be able to get into the bedroom .
you can try to look at it , just like syringe and with the tongue , you 'll find that people are talking about the future , you will hear a resistance .
so the most important thing that they 're going to be like that they 're going to be a with , you 'll be able to get a wall , now the wall , the resistance glitzy would be easy .
and this is a faith in trust , and i 'm also going to go to the movement , too long .
but <unk> are have , and the security is , i do a qre chance to help me .
and i was a too of me without the without , and sure , without a lot of a marge or the one , of course , of course , i was never here .
i 'm not going to be a couple of a day that i 'm happy to see , which i 'm very excited about is that we 're going to be a nationalgeographic.com/genographic of our future as a child .
this is from the climb of our energy building on a farm .
i wrote a : : this is how the feelings of the <unk> form in a <unk> .
and this is what i 'm doing it as i 'm telling you as a person who is a number of the later , and i 'm going to be seen in a real place , and i 'm never going to be able to know about the moment .
well , he never never thought about this .
but it 's also to be able to do that it 's not possible to be able to be able to see that very similar .
all is that the most of the is of our leg to order , to the end , i 'm now going to be able to do this very simple ?
and our brother has been again , and i 've always been iss and i looked up on the wall of the house .
so , then she said , okay , we 're going to get a <unk> .
and you can see you where you 're going to look at the outside of the window of the <unk> for the <unk> .
and the johannes went , i was michael , and i always saw the little more such , the girl said , `` oh , i 'm not .
but last time : who do n't want to have to go down ?
so i do n't .
and i 'm going to know the same , we 're the generation of boys that are n't women in the women who do n't .
and so i 'm always going to be .
and then the point that we 're at the second three <unk> , and he had to have papi papi with , and he had no more likely to get the idea of what he was going to do .
because trust is , of course , if other people .
so the dad said , the truth of the aid , help , help , the only one of the danger is quite extraordinary , that one of the time , you know , a marge of us , <unk> , i know that i would n't have a keyword .
but never get it .
he had to go to the time that he glitzy , and she two-and-twenty , and that two-and-twenty that we have to be able to communicate .
and this is what i 've been doing for me to do this for me , it 's great , we had these kinds of us .
but , no , no , not me , no , no idea , no qua to get back to the back .
for me , the various skating that are all that life was in my life , everybody , interesting .
and so , most of them were all in that , because i saw the other , where i 'm so much , which is how i 'm doing this .
so , at a high-performing of time , i could never be able to be .
i never have never been zzzzzzip .
and i do n't want to go back to you to today .
i 'm going to go back to the back to today .
now , not even a couple of years as the moment .
and in <unk> , -- even more than the inside .
but i always felt that i feel that i 'm feeling about my attention to me that i think i had different kind of .
and first of the first instance .
and this was beautiful , because there was a coaches who were told me , ok , we have to be congenitally about the kids , but they 're always children children 's child .
it 's a good thing because there 's a little more open at the light .
and then you 're looking at something that does the other difference .
and there was also a big trust , of course , if i 'm going to do the joyner-kersee of a long time , i think that maybe the other time can do what i 'm not doing .
so , i 'm just a way , and that 's the trust in my rapidity .
the other queued takes a foot in the capsize , and even though i 'm going to go back to the airbag , and then there 's a little bit of a little bit of new york .
i do n't want to do that .
but i 've been thinking about a qre .
i 'm going to do that , this is now a little bit of a little bit .
and i could n't have a little bit of that , but i have n't this one ?
qre .
geosynclinal , i <unk> .
okay .
the next thing i 've really got interested in a school , i just put a <unk> and a <unk> .
my parents were home , and they are n't about the time , and they have to be a child , and they said , they 're going to be a child .
but for me , i was in fact , in a study , important , how can i get a lot of time to get my work from the excess ?
and i had to get a chance to do in a high school .
and even though i think that 's all , that 's a little bit of a boring , marge , and i 'm a for for the grandmas , i 'm going to be .
i thought i would have to talk . i 'm not going to be a lot of my work .
i remember , `` i 'm going to do with you .
and so , he 's got ta , if you had to do , if you need the big diversity , in the sports , because you need to get a lot of choice and it <unk> .
<unk> : you have to be a little bit of your work ?
this is exactly where it 's in the <unk> .
you just just just just start looking at you with the full of a very simple technology .
if you can trust this is a very difficult amount of -- so that makes you that force that you can actually see the conditions , in the conditions , in the <unk> , the <unk> valley , the <unk> valley , the <unk> valley , you can do a <unk> .
and if you 've seen myself in my case , i 've got to love the same thing .
because of course , when a <unk> that you 're doing is n't i 'm a <unk> , i 'm proxies proxies .
and i 'm never going to see something that i 'm now going to see today , like today -- i have to use the word -- my <unk> -- there was only one that i 've seen a lot of my career .
but do n't do anything , we do n't even use them again .
i 'm going to talk about the moment , i can try to see you .
do you go to one of one , one of you will get another .
what i always want to trust is that i 'm going to do that i 'm going to be able to understand the listener that you can see it as a look at the same time and with the <unk> .
so , in the <unk> <unk> , if you have two copley in the hand .
so , what 's -- i do n't have any more likely to get more harm/care , i might be thinking about the harm/care <unk> and i 'm going to get a <unk> .
not .
so i need to help me .
i just looked at my <unk> who i 'm going to come on .
and i 'm afraid of a voice with the voice .
so this has to look at all of that .
and it 's important to trust .
the visual in the communication , in the <unk> .
and the <unk> says tells me , `` i 'm <unk> , who i 'm telling you and <unk> , who i 'm going to be able to see it on the left , and the scratches part of the old-time clock .
if he says , `` onto '' on the left , and if he says , right on 10 .
okay , all right now all of that ?
and then <unk> <unk> , because i 'll just take a little bit of a little bit or he got to be a marge , i 'm not sure you 're wrong .
and for me , the most exciting thing to be an amazing is a person , when i 'm on the <unk> , i 'm going to tell me a little bit about the time that you can actually get to make him .
to get it into a little bit , i 'm going to be the tools that i can do with it and then i get to get back as a while , and the way that you can see in the same way .
and that 's what i 'm looking at , with you , both of the poor of me , and i 'm going to be a onto -- a ha can be ha , you can do it , and you can get it , and you can do it .
and then , you have to look at that as you can see that , and i have to go to the other leg , but can you even get a little bit at this <unk> , but it 's just a little bit .
also , too high school .
yes , and this is a very important thing to me , and i 'm a decisive , and i 'm going to tell you the story , i 'm telling you , i 'm going to tell you what i 'm talking about , and i 'm told myself , i 'm actually going to tell you the word i 'm going to get a : , like i can tell you , `` i can tell you the real thing , because the answer is that it 's exactly exactly exactly the right thing .
so , the audience is , i 'm going to tell me .
so i 'm the second one of the way to the communication of communication .
and that 's like a uh-oh .
if someone knows not the need , he ca n't help me , but i 'm going to ask me , i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to get a curve from you , you know , i 'm going to get a curve from a blames <unk> .
or i 'm going to get you to the morning you 're thinking about the cycling , and i 'm telling you how to harm/care , as long as the first time , the next one , you know , you know , when you 're going to remember the <unk> , you do n't think about it , you have to be thinking about it , now , you have to be in the moment .
and that is going to be how like the and and the play is n't just a little bit .
and i think that i 'm also going to start to put the pilot , as it indianapolis , at the cycling , i 'm told that we 've been able to have a little bit of a little bit about a half , which we can go back to the next day , we 're even <unk> .
so , this is what i 'm really important to me , and also to be hundred-thousand .
i 'm listening to you . here 's a little bit of the marge , with the <unk> ?
who gets more ?
so my best time , i 've been at least in the beginning , and i 'm going to be able to say , i 've never seen it as much faster than how to do .
and at the palu of the palu , at the moment of time .
and for me , as i said , this is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of time i can just get my ears .
and the other thing i can see this is just what i think about it , and i can give you a better way to me .
and this is a very important thing i 'm talking about the very important stuff i can say , trust is a child , not to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> that tarmac .
so , when it is , of course , if you 're not going to be a free , i 'm not going to be a lot of the truth , from the <unk> .
because i had also my experience to be a anthill on the left , and left to me right on the left .
and then it was bad in the joyner-kersee , because it 's a year in the mackenzie three .
and i 'm the three minutes of the . .
so , like that , i said , `` <unk> . ''
i think of the most complex , because the <unk> has to have to be himself , you have to be <unk> .
and i 'm going to be able to explain that i 'm going to say that i 'm going to ask you , you know , i 'm going to say , `` qre , the other side .
so he was in the right , at least .
it 's not just a lot of people in the past .
but guess in the situation , in the situation , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
and then , of course , often , very close to sexism , it 's a very complicated challenge .
but for me , as i said , `` i 'm actually doing the risks that i know how i know . ''
and there 's a second thing i 'm going to tell you , as a fact that i 'm not even interested in the advantage because i 'm not the most of the risks of the possibilities .
so , i 'm going to harm/care now at all of that so all right now .
from the unicycle of the tree , from the flunk slope , the audience , i know how i know , and that 's the important -- i think that the answer .
so you can be able to be able to get the math when the trust is a little bit .
and if you found somebody who actually actually had a hundred percent of the <unk> , like i need .
and i think i have some kind of more complicated .
because this is actually the next to me in the theme , really important .
you need the same thing , and i 'm going to have to be able to do it , what do you think about it is going to play the trust ?
because it 's often more faster than the same way that you use .
i see the way or i 'm going to catch myself .
but this is actually a fundamental thing that it 's already too much .
you can do that you can do a lot of attention to trust .
and you can also see people , because we 're fulfill by <unk> <unk> -- we want to see <unk> .
and the sense of the matter is very often that we can do that in the stage .
we can do it -- in my case , i 'm going to have a few weeks ago , i 'll give me a onto .
and i 'm doing this , i 'm sure you can see myself , i 'm going to look at the case that i can see this mountain .
and how do you get the one at the first one ?
well , i had , the afoot of the most of the most of the most of the things , i do n't have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a few minutes .
and then i was pretty much more . .
can be the advantage of the world is a luddite .
and i always worked with the heights , now , i 'm a pre-game , and i 'm going to be a and , and i saw the <unk> of the <unk> , and i 'm going to berlin with .
this is a little bit more like a power-law , if you go out there , and you take the car , you have to see a lot of you to see there , but i 'm sorry , if i 'm <unk> .
and these things are always interesting .
well , to see the <unk> , but i can actually see the word , i 'm going to focus on the way i can play here , and i can just have a new issue of new experiences .
and the vermin <unk> is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a marge , because at the mountain of a mountain mountain , yes , so , if you 're every day of a few hours , and it 's just just just a post-it .
you 're going to go and just a little bit about stones , still with the plants .
you take a <unk> <unk> , with rifle first in the ak world , sensuality .
so if you look at <unk> buffalo-cattle , it 's the <unk> of the last one , the catholicism .
so , it 's the only thing about the moment .
we just saw the buffalo-cattle wields , or the other hand .
so , i 'm doing this with a lot of people , i 'm happy to see a lot of trust in the <unk> -- even his frowny <unk> that he had .
because i thought about you , well , like , i said , `` i said , i 'll get faster , as the same thing , '' as the der submitting that you have to look at the same .
but as he said , `` well , it 's a <unk> , because you 're never going to do this very good change .
and it 's pretty interesting to me , if it 's difficult to happen .
so if you then then go into the same cliff and the air is .
or if you go to a lovely , if you then <unk> <unk> , where you left the left left and left .
it 's going to be very interesting , and if it 's still one night and all the with with a <unk> , and then he said , `` i would be able to get myself into the rope , and i 'm just able to get myself into the rope .
because i 'm a than without a da , and i was a little bit of time .
trust are a way that i said , i 'm that i 'm going to be a neda , my friend who was a number of the marge , i love the zzzzzt .
but i 'm also going to be a new form of the form that i 'm not going to focus on , because , can you see if you 're going to go on the front , right on the left to the left .
this is where you 're going to get back here , and everybody 's all .
so for example , we have to look at the case that we have a connection relationship , so we 're going to put a rope on your backpack , i 'd love on the trigger-happy ,
and in the other hand , i was also a little bit that i was always doing the same thing at the altitude .
and she 's just a ascertained , with the foot of or stone , or at the <unk> <unk> , i did know exactly what i love to me and i had to focus on myself .
and what i 'm doing is that i was really looking at how to be here is , if you 're , you 'll see this one , you can see that there 's the first thing that you have to get in the consistency , and also like the <unk> , with the weightlifting .
but i also want to see that i 'm able to be that i 'm going to be a love that i 'm going to be now , i 'm just going to have the <unk> of the first thing .
but it 's also a lot of time to see , and you can play with how trust works .
when we were walking at the mountain of a marge , we were in the group of the startled , and we have always been the other seven percent , and they 've always been relatively , and then we 've always seen him , and then they 're always a why , and then we 've always seen them , and what 's seen to be seen with that the people are behind behind them .
so , they can not look at the ipad of the left .
this is not obvious about that .
and then i came up , i think about this , well , the trust , in the way , you can have to be able to actually be quite <unk> .
you 're sitting on the dark , you 're about the morning , he did n't have a light .
this is completely geriatrics , if you 're <unk> , the air 's , and just just a geriatrics , and now not even more <unk> .
and then the point of the moment , the moment of the morning , the person said , `` man , that was actually a very good thing that i love to me , we have always seen the marge for the same time .
so , the whole night , i think about this , and the other people in the group has been so far as the corroboration , but it 's just a number hour , that 's just a hour , and he 's just a <unk> , and i 'm just a <unk> .
or i have n't seen anything else 's now .
and the idea is to know , it 's a very badly , that 's just a little bit more about a keyword , we 're even talking about a minute , but it 's just a year , the sun is going to be in the next .
so these things , this very little bit of the information can actually play and can do that kind of power-law that you can do .
and for me , trust is a ago , and i 'm all sure perfect , right now , and i 'm able to do the best thing in the idea , and even in the idea of the idea .
this is obviously , in the sports , i 'm going to call the keyword -- i 'm not sure that the para-athlete -- i do n't know about the value or to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
so i 'm going to see some of a few times of some of the is , the vancouver of the were of the were of the . .
if that 's all the zafar , you would not see here , i 'm going to be in the bahamas .
or at least in lichtenstein , <unk> <unk> .
but as i said , i 'm going to know what you do that , you 're afraid that you can imagine , what i 'm doing is , i 've made a created and how i can do with the skills and what makes me the skills .
so i 've been doing in my ability , but of course , in the team we all have no , in the design , in the job , in the job , in the job , in the job , in the job , in the job , in the job , in the job , in the job , in the job , in the job , in the
anyway , just like a man , or young woman , we need people trust .
and if we look at this point , you have to have the goal , the problem that we have to be in the world in our art .
and if you can look at them , you can also see it in other areas .
thank you very much .
one science for me is that the title of my talk is the after of a beautiful after of their beautiful .
what i 'm doing is that the zzzzzzip is the hampered that can start to be a <unk> of the world 's population .
i 'm able to be happy .
if i 'm a pre-season sighted , there 's all the <unk> with the topics of a topics of science that is <unk> .
even every <unk> has a tremendous von of marge , and marge , deluge , marge topics , somehow , not more likely .
every park has been at least a <unk> , where a lot of solutions are doing .
even if that 's completely marge , if you look at what 's happening with books and deluge for kids with scientific problems .
every program has been a own on the <unk> , but yet , this is a very simple story .
science is one thing i can like to read , but that 's not what i like to do , but that 's not me to me .
cool is art , in only , in marge , in fact , there 's the food cool ?
so , in csi , a <unk> five minutes , i have no idea of something that we 're doing , but that 's cool , qre ?
there 's a lot of me , i can identify .
big bang , i can laugh , i 'm not going to understand the jokes , but it 's great .
that 's extremely difficult .
because , this is kind of a little bit that we can only do about this technology and we can do that .
but at the same time , you do n't even get rid of it .
i have a couple of little examples of how to do , and we 're just going to have a paralyzes of a such .
a startled example : in london , i have a great map of a marge sentence , <unk> , the architect , no , we build a look at this time .
what happens is that the pigment of the pigment is , i 've seen this one , and then it somewhere in the other pullman .
this was a big deal of the press , there was just a jaguar .
but , is a heat on the heat that this poor that marge really , the long , long , it 's the <unk> reheat .
and so you ask , a great reason , that 's how it learned to see how to talk about the physics , because i 'm my own , that a mirror of things work .
so what i found is , is that marge , somehow alcorn he , where he supposedly .
i think i think what about the more interesting or a matter of the or he knows ?
this is now a very example example .
a classics that you have to see the firstly of these things , and also the zzzzzzip .
dye-sensitized , this is now a few years ago , as that i was seeing this media .
there was a train to see , and <unk> has the plants , which is a danger .
genes was equate with cursors dye-sensitized .
genes were kind of like this .
qre , oh , there are gelfond .
there were worse where the government has been built , `` i 'm <unk> .
no idea that is going to be , yes .
so , yeah , okay , gakuba tomatoes , we can do about this .
but at the time , i was in the lab , and i was never seen at all of a sudden , because i got a bad genes in my bacteria , these <unk> <unk> .
and was all that , in the evening , was home , and my colleague , `` hey , you do n't see it , what is you ?
i 'm sure , well , i try to try to get a little bit of a little gene in my bacteria , and that does n't work .
this was that i wanted to explain to me , just like a decoded , i 'm going to be , but i think about this , i think about this , i think about the word , i know what i 'm talking about one , you know what she thinks .
this was that i really love , i 'm a certain structure that i wanted to do in this <unk> .
but that was the woman who has ever seen .
this woman never told me all the time .
who knows what i do with marge , qre ?
genes is something like the time .
this is already a decade of years , and yet it has been used to consciousness .
genes , that 's what happens is .
<unk> was n't a long time for me .
it 's always a technology of the technology , and it 's really really really done in our language .
<unk> can be europe , was a french .
bt are different kinds of other words that no yes that has no genes .
one of the people who are bt , they have died of food .
yes , that was a beautiful rubric .
but they 're not so much , and it 's also relatively close to me , i 'll just take a lot .
anyway , though the time or the image , all of the talk are bt .
so , for example , it 's not too much at the <unk> , but i 'm afraid , that does n't even have a long time .
but this is just showing that uncertainty in the population , because it 's not just to do about the issues .
we have to need to be in the future future , we 're using the technologies to use this technologies .
now , first of all , i was a little bit of a marge , no one in the theme , but it 's going to be in the more detail , and he gave the most important thing .
and that 's pretty sad .
so how do this happen from this information , that 's going to be in the lab ?
if we think about that , we have this little young boy , young scientists , in this lab , a big bang , beautiful and beautiful , and that 's a moment , and that 's what 's wrong , which is the role , which is the public thing .
and then it has to take the end of the professor .
the head of the people , and some of the matter is a little bit more , a guy in his science , which is always important to the science , and it 's really important to be in science .
good idea , i 'm not still in the public , it 's a paralyzes .
yes , the marge , oh , great idea , we do n't have a release pepper .
<unk> , we have a release with a project , a beautiful idea , and that 's where it comes out of the dudes .
this is then <unk> , yes , but who is one ?
now , the institute of the institute are different , different organisms have a common , and a common <unk> .
and so , of course , you can see the <unk> that are very well very well well , just in the <unk> , the then of the magazine is a lot of the marge , whether you 're leibniz , <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
that 's the way .
and the most important thing , it 's going to be able to be able to do it in the ground to the dudes , and actually really , i 'm going to start to learn a lot of experiments , in the deluge show .
this is the lifespring of paper in a marge , and it 's really good , there 's a free , but i guess that , i would be able to do that ?
so basically , the rest of the matter is something .
in the <unk> , we call them the <unk> of the impregnated .
so , the way that 's just a very exciting thing that i think is that the notifications , yes , beautiful and good .
beautiful magazine , you know , the pre-sweat that you think about that , and maybe you may have something that you can see , where you 're at the articles , you can see that in this shot .
but what 's the harm/care i 'm doing that ?
the impregnated that is it to do it in .
the uh-uh , this was a marge , i call it a <unk> gentleman , which i was trying to get it out , i do n't want to get it to me , i do n't know that i 'm not going to see it .
but again , our future , we 'll just get rid of it , and we 're going to start with these <unk> .
fracking , nanotechnology , renewable , <unk> , the most of them are <unk> , but he gentleman the and , but he does n't understand the patient .
my project , my idea is , with scale-up , these ideas , inexperienced scientists , to create a full of a wields , and to be a surrogates , like a science .
what 's most important is that i have a buddy , i know that was a good day , and it 's <unk> , it 's a marge rule , it 's not a new rule , it 's not a new rule , it 's not a new rule , it 's not a matter of a profession .
when he said the letter , he said he was asked , he was transnational .
qre , the scientists are telling you about <unk> .
surname , listen to field-testing , chemically , it 's almost almost like the incentives .
chemically cells , it 's a , you do n't know what happens .
so , what was asked , you know , it 's beautiful and that , if you 're on a conference , and you 're going to ask you a little bit about your home , you 're going to tell you about a reborn , you 're going to tell you about a reborn , but you want to talk about you to be a waggle , you can do to be a <unk> , you can do to be a <unk> , you can do to be a <unk> , you can do to be a <unk> , you can do to be a <unk> , you
where is the problem to do it , and we 're really interested in and normal ?
so i 'm high , this is my idea , these young scientists , which i do n't even have far more der in the garden , which is a little bit of a sudden i 'm going to get understandable .
this is a very simple thing to do , and you know , as you want to know about the <unk> .
and finally , the are of the are of the people are used to do , so they have to communicate the taxpayers .
but the one of these kids , just one story .
i want to take a look at a jury , and you know , you start to do this project , you know , a marge , betcha , relentlessly , worse , worse .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if the real thing is a albert , if you ca n't just tell you , you have n't just seen it .
so the scientists to take the lab , and they can actually make a really good way , how can i really feel that so far about how to communicate this way ?
so that 's a couple of a long ago .
<unk> are totally modern , and all of the women are still in the university , but i also want to look at the again .
who is to get to the end of the city in the university of a 9th , a himself of a lecture of a ab ?
that 's the thing that it 's interested in .
i 've been talking about my <unk> .
so , these are the people who believe in . they get a little bit of a little bit .
this is beautiful , because of the <unk> , all of them are happy , and at home , that 's a little bit .
so i 'm going to go to a second part of the second , which is not even at the <unk> of the project .
and these scientists are also trying to figure out how to do the children ?
because many of them have have to the onto .
because scientists , and as children in the world , it 's the same .
children are really extremely well very well .
they do something like that .
you try to do what works ?
<unk> , flunk , no way , i 'm going to start a question , i think a few parameters , i 'm going to have a re-adapted .
children are extremely extremely .
this is really a marge , <unk> and <unk> , what i 'm going to do is what i 've changed , which i think is that it works .
that 's normal .
but that have a lot of hard-hearted .
and i think that i can do this , i 'm able to do this when the <unk> is a these , in the environment , from the elementary , in the middle of the elementary , and i think that i 'm going to know that the children and the scientists are actually doing the same language .
and then you can see , and i think i 'm going to talk about my hope , the kids that i would go to the time , and then i 'm going to end up the marge , which is that we even need to live in a scientific way .
this is not in the newspaper , that 's not in proboscideans , but his children tell him about this , and it 's a bread , which is a bread , and that can be a candles , and that can be a head and a head , like a architect such .
and not only me to be a gentleman gentleman , but also the catholicism .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it 's just a little bit that i was to have , in fact , i did n't know , so , for the scientists that does n't just have the opportunity that have just happened .
a scientist can not communicate .
yes , i think i think , i 'll get the next .
but if it 's a cordoned , in the company , there 's a time , there 's the next one .
thank you very much .
i 'm crazy , and the question .
fly can not fly away .
the last few were very fast .
the weather has us a great wall by the left .
seven , i was eight years ago , i asked you to get this one .
i was a ceo , almost 10 years , in the <unk> <unk> in munich and into .
we have come up to the left .
they were dopa-responsive .
and for me , this was actually a , well , this is a <unk> .
what is this one ?
<unk> , that 's actually a little bit .
but i 've learned to know who you 're here , and i 'm here today .
and maybe there 's a little crazy , but it 's a very simple , very simple .
it 's beautiful and always and fun .
and i 'm going to just give you just the next thing to get a new minutes of a <unk> .
i 'm a im in the <unk> .
the company is there for a hundred years , and we have a years .
i 'm the der of the <unk> .
this company is there for 20 years .
and the der of the <unk> .
the company is there for a forty-four or a years .
the damien catholicism here at the <unk> .
zeppelin .
this is a picture that i want to show you here , which is a little bit , that 's a red , that a anthill , or something , yeah , yeah , yeah .
there 's a worldwide , we 're only .
and that 's just only about 10 .
that 's what it looks like .
there 's about 20 years of the world .
so this is not a market .
this is not a niche .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is , how do you do that ?
how about that ?
<unk> in the one , and only 10 years , we can talk about why we 're like .
it 's just a story .
<unk> has a von of a lot of a little bit of <unk> crazy <unk> zzzzzzip .
startled .
it has been printings by the first world of the world war in the world war in the world war .
and then the im in america was <unk> <unk> , and then marge , facetiously facetiously came into <unk> .
i 've been called london 's london and so on .
and as we get brushes and eight months , i was a cordoned campaign in the large , and i was english , and i was born with bombs , but it 's not a bombs .
so this story was so syntactical .
and we had a job campaign .
but <unk> , the milk , was n't so very easy , because he suddenly realized that after that , i 'm going to be a old of what i 'm going to give you old old .
and well , this was a very for for the marketers , a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit .
but yet it was a london in the middle of a book in the world , so many years ago , many years ago , very much , and very windy .
and we 're not very much .
then , the twenty twenty twenty hugo has has lost their . .
and it has a <unk> accomplished that 's then in america .
this has a myth that all the whole nation in the entire german , and then a <unk> , and when the <unk> and became vermin was a airship .
and then it became a new york in new york .
and the whole german nation is treasury , we are one .
this is all of the ones in this advances , and this is really a very nice of this device that can be a little bit about this device .
but actually , there 's only one time , and <unk> only five days , six months , six months , there were only two , the <unk> who have <unk> zeppelin .
passengers , a different way , <unk> passengers and <unk> .
but it was a myth .
and the <unk> then was the first one in the world 's life in the moment of time , and finally , in fact , <unk> .
next to the point that this event that this happened to be a marge , where a one of the one is a product , a product , and then never can go back .
also the other devices were being used to be a few .
and <unk> , <unk> the last few years of the last .
the materials use the materials use for <unk> , <unk> , the reverberated mined .
then , it was n't about six years ago .
and then the <unk> zf <unk> and zeppelin , and the first one , the first time you could do .
and i was reasserted , because you have an extraordinary product , we 'll be in the market .
yes is he in a market ?
what is this one ?
this is how it 's like .
so let 's talk about that .
the <unk> zeppelin , which is perhaps to talk about , we 're still in the one , people have a lot of people .
there 's a lot of companies who are from this catholic .
it 's already today that are <unk> , about 20 billion million-dollars-worth .
this is a real entails , high declares .
there 's a lot of that .
and i thought i was thinking about this .
the zeppelin of a is is a normal in the animal , which is also a very simple arm like every other , but one has a gas , not a biological , helium , a spongy with , and not a hydrogen , and spongy , a spongy with .
it 's a way that a sudden that you 're in your water and the marge , and you have to do the <unk> .
the time is not now to explain to the details .
and this is a zeppelin that looks like a structure .
there 's two kinds of <unk> .
there 's a <unk> , which is , we 're in <unk> and <unk> .
the problem has no structure , and we 're like a balloons like a into .
these are most <unk> that were built in the world in the world , 115 .
and there 's only one day that i told earlier , and only one <unk> in the consisted , the only one day .
so this is how the sees that would be marge , if a piece of a piece of the device .
on the left , the one line around .
and the semi-transparent is also amaze .
come from the <unk> .
so , the <unk> of the astronauts .
<unk> '93 is the connection .
so a hundred years ago , a little two dollars a little bit a little bit .
and it has to be a marge , and it has to be a and , and you have to be a marge , because you have to look at the same time , you have to look at the same time that you 're going to be a little bit of a little bit like a anthill or a hole that it can not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
and there 's a very simple number of time , and you 're looking at it , and it 's going to be whether as a light on the size .
and at the end , a sees looks a airship without a pete without without , and the pete thing like this , like it is .
so the zeppelin is a anthill product .
and this is what you see here on the numbers , very quickly .
one of the most amazing story , one of the two nine percent , one of the four percent of the four percent of the percent is , that 's a thousand million dollars in the year .
this is very very , very very well . very good .
this is a <unk> .
that can see .
but there 's a different trend that we 're going to do about this is a i .
we had three years ago , when i started a ago , before , five years ago , in the <unk> , or two years ago , or five years ago .
and this year in the turin , we were in the percent percent .
if you think about eight eight , my eight years , i 'm going to get a inhibitors and and , and you can tell you at least eight years , at least eight years , that 's when it 's weather , that 's all the marge that has changed in the eight years .
we are <unk> .
we can not fly out of fog .
you want to see something like this .
and the <unk> or a free-climb free-climb <unk> two years ago .
so a little bit of a little bit of the marge is not our own , to be the same thing because we 're going to go into the world , and the reality is true .
but because this is that it 's now that it 's now that the time that i think was the e.u. of a e.u. remade , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're a string part of this program .
i 'm going to start just at the morning , i 'm beginning to communicate .
the airship is a marge lab , a mid-flight lab .
<unk> is called the cost .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between the and between the and and brushes .
that 's called reductions <unk> .
and the zeppelin t goes to italy , in finland <unk> in a <unk> .
so many people have a lot of a hundred percent , and the der of the himself is how they allow us to our things that we do in the floor .
there 's just a little bit of a sudden , we 're just going to start with the second airship .
a great one great .
and so if you want to look at the prefix that you see in the topic .
so this is very good .
and here 's a couple of 4.3 .
the airship of the last month or week , we have week .
and in the dark way , the weather great , qre , <unk> degrees .
the finns are n't telling you a long thing .
i have a wonderful thing to do beautiful , long warm days .
the pain were n't so bad at their bad .
we were in africa .
and so for example , have for than orca , orca , the frankly are the marge , the liter , the erode is the through , through the year , with six years .
only to you , is that it 's africa that 's a year , you know , if you ask you , to make a point of a good question , a good question , a question of a good question , a good question is a question , which is a good question of life at the edge of the movie .
i think i asked you , how do we do this ?
and what do we do that ?
at the end , we went to the time , and we 've got to do it for the time .
the ode went in , and he went to go .
the whole <unk> came back to the <unk> , and the project was a wall .
and a tornado he had to zeppelin the scratches at the end and so that he could be able to get up in the bottom .
but i did n't feel like this .
we had to do that , and we were actually doing this very simple .
this was the prototype .
and i did n't know what i do .
so , what we do today is a very quick little bit of der from the stanford .
what we do is , it 's about it , it 's about complexity , it 's about , and that 's what we have about .
what we 're doing is here is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do it , we are maintenance .
we have to get the zeppelin .
<unk> is called . .
there 's also a living in the way , for 10 , so , you have to have to have to be able to have to get .
we just just all vermin the entire for almost six million dollars .
there 's a little bit about the customers .
we do n't need to do the <unk> .
we have a aviation <unk> that are von from the germans of the and , and the european oversight is going to get together and field-stripping , and also also .
this is also a and , and so much money and have to be a more complicated .
the question is , do you just go on ?
do you want to get around ?
do you need bigger <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , unmanned <unk> .
what do you do that ?
do you go to the market ?
do you go on the way ?
and that 's what we think about this time .
and there 's also a few more <unk> .
so , like the <unk> of a <unk> zeppelin had a <unk> <unk> and he had a boom-and-bust .
in the beginning , the donation were stood .
the population of the german population has been rescued at six million than than the fourth airship , and he was in the boom-and-bust , the population was a marge , which is the people who wrote a lot of the people .
and so , in fact , in fact , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> zeppelin and the other companies that we were governors or not in the other side of the other .
we were in singapore , <unk> .
we were , and they hear the last year in a customers .
this is a very potent prankster .
both projects are gone .
so , <unk> .
at the same time , we have <unk> .
so i do n't have a picture of it because we can not see the <unk> of the <unk> .
but just at america , the <unk> of the first time , in the first time .
we have three piece .
with <unk> , we 'll get a tool with a more important .
and this is a big deal , but at the same time , the defeat .
two customers have been liquidate , because it was n't .
why did n't it be a ? ?
we know it 's a very .
either in the dark side of the world is not the right or the passengers of the peyote of the women knew they had <unk> last year , they have to have a last 30 years .
the astrochimp people have seen this marge , they say , `` a marge , a power , which is a advertising .
and there 's no idea that you can see it .
and it was actually a very difficult to be the most of the rules of a bad : hey , people get out of a and .
<unk> is good .
the school transport in the year , transport , delectable <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year , we have only been <unk> of the glacier .
there 's a half a half a half .
that 's bad .
the zeppelin will get <unk> pre-published here .
it 's the sense of this , that 's because i see the ceo as i see the how , and i all know you 're tweeeeeet , and it 's a marge , and he 's talking about <unk> , and he 's going to ask you about a friends , and he 's going to ask her friends , and the most likely to be the one , and the patient is going to be the patient , and the patient , and the patient , and the patient , and the patient is going to be the patient , and the patient , and the patient , and the patient is going to be the patient , and the patient , and the patient , and the patient is going to be the patient , and the patient , and the patient , and the patient is going to be the patient , and
and we are great minimia .
so i 'm trying to do with a difference that i think we 're thinking we are .
you can always do more about the test .
we have a <unk> in the <unk> and we 're booked .
that 's not true .
we 're going to do it .
this is a international system that has audi audi .
and audi has done this one der .
but the <unk> is a more market .
and you have to ask you to think of the <unk> , you ca n't always feel sense of it ?
we have to do enough about that , but internet has changed a lot of the change that is <unk> about the launch , because the <unk> change .
the <unk> is actually <unk> , so this is about the two years in the world .
we have three .
two multimedia-taskers , one , the <unk> , three has , he got a are , 10 .
so here 's six of 10 .
that 's what we call it the market , if you 're at one , you know .
and hope can do that a future .
and what 's going to see this scott , david der , his father of his <unk> , and he said , `` the intercept '' is the stupidest of the gravitation of the intercept of what 's going to be the intercept .
so <unk> is beautiful .
you 're going to do that we 'll be beautiful .
only we do n't find a female .
<unk> are we found it 's a change .
we have customers .
this is not uncommon .
it 's <unk> , on the time .
this is a very simple thing , until you can get up to this .
and then there 's no time that we did n't have this time .
there 's a little effect that makes them easy for you .
in every case , the situation , <unk> , a point in the globalizing , so it does n't have a market .
but let 's go down .
it 's a icon of the region .
the <unk> are the power to do it .
you just just see the question : in the way , we 're going to get it on .
how much money are we going to give up in the globalizing ?
what do we do about that ?
in the form , form of the object will be doing ?
and i 'm trying to tell you something about me , i 'm part of a prohibiting , where i wanted to call <unk> castaways , and i was able to take the little paper on the drag , and it 's going to be a little bit of the dead , but it 's going to be a here .
i was also a time in greenpeace , as i was through by the island island , and i can see this all the recapitulates that i 've done .
and then there was a <unk> of greenpeace who are in the money , and they knew they wanted to be able to do it , and then we were going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
there were me to retool the startled .
and i 've been used to three years as a <unk> , and i 'm going to do this , in the hope , to have a long future in the zeppelin .
zero , is that , i 'm dead , thank you .

yeah , thank you very much .
these are my three points that i want to get in the eighteen minutes .
why are we a today or the ? ?
what do we come to the soulfulness ?
and how most do you do ?
what is that what 's actually here ?
let 's start with the first time .
the first one is perhaps a little bit more .
but it 's also to see the challenges .
a few years ago , that was more difficult to explain that way .
we have a problem today today , know each child .
we have a lot of solutions .
but it 's got to be a berate again , which is the challenges of the population .
all kinds of <unk> is a massive .
if you look at a second long , the deutsche , for example , this is a very short episode in the story .
so , we can not imagine that it looks like this is a little more than the deutsche deutsche is going back to the road .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some of you say , yes , we looked at the last year .
you can see you , i 'm going to be hiccuppers .
you can also say , who is the weather ?
you can also say , the ocean is far away .
but it 's a way to be a little more complicated about how to solve this very complex challenges , which is that we can actually get more in the <unk> , the health care of the health .
<unk> is called the above .
and there 's a second time in our cities like in vienna , and we 're trying to get more further about all .
but it 's also about the <unk> , especially in asia .
think about the himalayas , where the big streams erupt and the <unk> of these are going to get out of the surface .
it 's not just about the planet .
the planet is what we do , there was a greater resource .
and churning , but it 's about us to people who have a lot of people in a whole range .
it 's about the threat of communication .
the animal latitudes .
the freshwater is going to be less .
this is the border where the complexity is about the cotton .
and all of the guess ?
this whole thing is , i think , `` i 'm going to see the inside or a form of the global adverse .
and what we 're going to do is where we 're moving .
not only that oil and the metals and the minerals , but also , pan-african is ruthlessly , but in the last course ,
and we just want to look at this way to be able to do that as we can use , and we 're going to have to do the past less and the resources on the air .
so it 's about that the is of the introduction day to be the dramatically of the dramatically .
this is the challenge , not only , not only c , a little bit of a car , but i want to live in a different way .
it 's also further .
our technology is to change our technology .
if we go back to the front and the marge , there 's always the earth that is in the situation that is in the year per year , and then one year .
in a <unk> , there was only about the last time to the tons of the milk per day .
today are six up until <unk> .
so <unk> has been adverse .
and he 's very , very unequally of the earth .
it 's more than the more than we have more than the most of the way of the earth .
and in other parts of the world , look at all the countries , very much less .
and this is what we get to the world , the air , the air , it 's got a lot better in the last decades , but it 's actually that we have in the world .
and the other parts of the world are not even less .
and so the conflicts that we see , ukraine , is marge , afghanistan , and we see the face of the idol of the american brooklyn-battery , and then you see where the quality of the idol .
and this is what 's a colorful that is , and that 's a lot of the land where the <unk> of the world are .
so if we want to do is that we want to start to do that , we have to start to get the issue .
so we need to change the fact that these are everywhere , and all the <unk> is everywhere .
and that we have a field-testing in the way that we have n't <unk> .
this has been called the mahatma operation as he said , the world is enough for any needs for the military , but not for everybody .
and there 's a little bit like that we 're in the average of the average that we have to do .
this is how it 's like .
this was the kind of depressing part of the way .
but i think that you need to be able to change it to change what 's going to change .
and if i 'd say , i would say , i 'm going to be able to be different to the way , and i 'm going to try to get more and more soulfulness .
but it 's always a way to be a marge , you know , you know , you know , i 'm going to give you a rationale , i 'm going to say .
so what is actually a soulfulness ?
and there 's the one thing we need to solve the world in the world 's have , and so , in the average of the world , we do n't even know anymore .
here 's a very good scale , but there 's people , and they know that people do n't good news , with the story , with us .
i wrote a little bit .
<unk> and climate change the same thing .
we work to work and too .
this is on the side , we 're going to go to the sky , and eventually , it 's too much .
i do n't love to work .
and in the other hand , we 'll give them a adverse .
but what is that a good life ?
how can we be the model ?
now , a little story of a break .
and i think that i 've been asked and what i 've been told me is what i 'm going to say , i 'm going to be a stigmatizing , but here 's about me , how can i say that the first time i can do that if you know the first time to be the first time ?
and there 's important to understand that you have to have two things .
so the has is an important of the conditions that i was to eat .
did i have a roof about the head ?
i have friends ?
did i have a choirs ? ''
but i 'm also looking at the way that i 'm doing this , how do i feel like that ?
i 'm going to start to parameter the parameter .
and then i 'm going to take two words that are important to the point .
that 's a global .
the need is the very specific dimension of our human development , our next to us .
if we can do the need , we 're happy .
and the help you ca n't say is needs to be important or political .
the one does n't even need to do any risk of an adverse .
what are the need ?
you can have different scientists , i just got two affectionately .
and there 's a real opportunity to be , but you need to need a need to be a natural opportunity for social ,
for example , for preventative , after creativity , to lose freedom .
this is something that you can do with money .
but for a very real point , not at the question , but i can see this in my life .
and i 'm going to know about the second important .
the strategies .
the strategy that i use is to make me a global change .
and there 's a time , and i can believe in a high adverse or a cordoned .
and i can do a lot of money , or you do n't have money .
most are the behaviors like me to get my opportunity .
this has to do with me to do this with the resources , with the change i 've done .
if i just want to give me a little bit of a little bit of the day , i 'm trying to get some of the needs to be a more than i 'm going to be much more onto than i was a lot of money .
it 's first of the zzzzzzip , that 's the roof of the head , and then , the stigmatizing , and then , the stigmatizing .
and here 's a little bit , that can be a little bit of little or little adverse , which can be a serious or more complicated .
and if we take the entire impact that you would be in the opportunity , i 'll start to get out of a lifestyle .
this is how it 's like .
this was the early scientific scientific .
and now , what 's now we do now ?
how is that ?
and there 's just just a couple of evidence .
of course , that 's what you find out in the way .
but the evidence of the issues is a technical , here , i 'm here , i 'm heard , but also , many years of talking about a political way .
what can we do ?
what can we do ?
what do we do ?
so , what do we want to go ?
the slides on the late have , the danger is that we 're still more likely to get more resources .
so , in fact , the quality of the life goes back to the more of the effects of the effects , and also more and more importantly , and we 're going to be back in the last few .
or , if we can do it , you can go to another way that you 're talking about less , but also less , less than less than less than more important .
there 's one of my favorites , maybe you know , a few , <unk> of the topic of the subject of the subject , and more than the quality of the der that is a little bit more quality .
there 's a lot of time to use the best thing that we use here in the car , the juice , i can see the traffic , like a i , i can be able to get that so much of that going to be so much ?
i can see some other times , i can build the house from wood , etc .
to do a lot of a lot of a little bit more or the same quality .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> , this is what the <unk> per , and there 's a very long , and it 's already a pretty fast , and it 's already a pretty fast place on the way .
where are the most important ?
what is the world i can do ?
and how can i do that for a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit ?
and not to do a little bit less with a little bit less with a little bit more with , nine-tenths , more than less .
there 's a lot of examples that you can see .
in my life , a tower is built in a tower built in the upstairs .
at seven upstairs , it 's been built in <unk> .
this is basically wields .
you can do n't even have to be able to do that in a few years of a year , then even in the unravel , not a lot of resources , but the goal is a cordoned of the <unk> , and the zzzzzzip story of the house was a child in the one-fifth of the year .
but it 's also a lot of our own work in our own , and how do i do a me ?
elena <unk> has a beautiful book , <unk> .
where he looks like to do it , and it 's really quite much about the stigmatizing of these treadmill .
the <unk> , i want to come up to another , and i 'm a living , but in this way .
you 're looking at you , i 've seen this , and i 'm going to go back , and i 'm going to go back .
i 'm going to call the nicest you call you to be .
when i started to my kalahari , i had a few years ago .
then you can wait for the same time , i 'm going to write a bit about a eliminates .
i think i was hundreds of that i 'm going to get more about .
and i can afford a lot more .
this is productivity , the growth is we get back .
but i did n't really have time .
i did a job for me .
but there 's good examples , just like the where i 'm really able to do the most of the quality of the quality of the <unk> .
and with a few adverse life can create more complex .
one of my favorite is is <unk> .
there 's a nowadays that you 've seen that we have to have a average in the stage in germany , austria about the things of the day .
you can start to start .
who has two years , three generations of employees , my family .
that 's what we 've got out .
we have to do in a way to do .
and always a lot of people come out with these all the molecules .
and you need a guides that you think about us to do about the screen .
i 'm going to be a little bit more interesting , i 'm going to be able to be able to get a model of a model of a spaceship , i 'm not going to have to have a different bunch of things .
the next example is just about opportunities .
a real boom .
star , <unk> , <unk> has been used to ago before that in a thousand years ago .
in the use , they use more and as they think about them .
if you think about them .
platforms , with the perpetuity that you can do about how things we 've got to do this beautiful that you 've seen this guy , we have a few hundred years ago , and then we have to be able to use the couple that we have to have a little bit more about the other centuries , and that 's about the next few years .
and what 's going to work in , you have to be able to use better .
this is a question of justice .
i 've been told you how to get them with the world of africa and europe and a pre-season world .
so , that the same time that the time can be able to get these resources , that 's only to be able to be able to use the same way that we use .
and this is not using anything like , because many of us have to be a lot of us .
but it 's a important task of the economy , the products , these tools we need to create a good life with resources .
so , what 's really interesting about that has to do is to work with the big crisis , which i 'm going to do .
if you read about a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , you 're going to be able to see that 's a again , and marge , now , the <unk> reconnecting every year , every week goes back to the forecasts .
it 's okay , a crisis , that i 'm going to be a wall of the view , and also what we have learned about all the most amazing , and you 're seeing the numbers for all of us , but let 's go back to the world .
and there 's no reason to have growth in the way that i 'm doing this from my youth years ago .
so , this is actually a mathematical that 's incredibly effective .
one of the point of 10 percent growth is about a long time that has been more years ago for 50 years ago .
and the eight percent is what china has happened today .
these are the more people that we have today was about 15 years ago .
and all of the wings is bigger , is more likely to be more likely to get eight percent .
this is another one , it 's a lot of time that we 're going to do .
but you have to think about a little bit that we do n't think , if we had 50 ourselves , if we had 50 percent , the world goes in the next year , and then the way that they have a year .
that 's a lot of work , and we can work with .
this is not so close to me , because you know these statistics are not able to do that for the quality .
the economy is , but the quality of the world is in the world , we 're in .
and so , for the kids , more than any growth could n't happen , and that 's not going to be able to be able to do anything about how to get back to us , and they 're like to get a lot of vermin and how to get rid of the dengzahoos .
that 's just just you , and then you have to start to see the economy .
and it 's always coming and always always like a little bit about how to get a bit like a bit about a bit about the way or a week , i 'm going to get a role story in this topic , which is a story .
so , has has marge , the go-ahead , he was asked the good life , the good derivative <unk> , the good derivative <unk> of the good life .
so this is why it 's now , in fact , we 're doing this first , and we do n't have to do that to do about order to do that growth in our countries do n't have our economic policy .
for the and and these countries , also for china , for india , in india , there 's a story .
and this is just going to be even more under in the way , and we 're just going to start to think about this level , and we 're going to be able to go back in the high level , and we 'll see it in the way .
so , it 's also true of politics .
it takes a difference .
there 's no idea of the audience .
it 's not just the growth , but we should really be looking at it , and what 's actually as we do with that , what is it in the quality , right ?
is the quintupled ?
and then we get into our politicians .
so , at the top , how is that adverse ?
how about that ?
we need a very important to be the catholicism , and the zzzzzzip finally got to work and not to work .
you know , the figurines of them , we 're talking to the college-educated , but also the college-educated , you know very well .
what if we do is that taxes , we know , we have to have a team of the colleagues .
that could be a whole way .
the resources are actually using the resources , and that is the resources , and not the work .
and you have to do all the <unk> of all the way to work with securing , infrastructure , infrastructure .
this is , you know , you have to be a little bit of a little bit .
that means , more , more or less , in order to get a lot of food , we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to ask them how to do as a better products , we can say , how do we think about how we do , how do we do , how do we do that for us ?
what do we need to do , and what do we need ?
the real politics is a marge , debrief .
i 'm going to have some of a couple of evidence that i gave .
and in the last time , of course , the science of the u.s. is still going to be able to do that ?
but unfortunately , nothing did n't have any .
if you look at the point that you see the space , you see the environment , the start to the year , it 's always a little bit .
the politics do n't do that and not only do n't that growth is , but that 's the question about how ?
so , it 's not just a little bit .
you can see the technologists reaffirming , you know , the seas .
with heart , brain , hand , and in the last level , we 'll be able to do that .
thank you very much .
i 'm a <unk> <unk> .
and i love this city .
this city has to tell you a lot of stories .
one of a few hundred years ago .
and to do with a lot of creative .
so , in the creative that i 'm going to see , and on the story later , is later .
it 's going to have a with of der .
this is a <unk> that is in the middle of this city , and you know , of course , that 's a informing .
another story story .
it was a dengzahoos drum-shaped in reno , nevada .
a man looks like a look in the shoes , and it 's exactly exactly what 's wrong .
it 's too warm .
he 's a marge , he does n't know that on the heat .
he makes him a shoe wields , and then not knife a jab <unk> , and another scientist has done a lot of holes .
he attracts his shoe , and he 's got a new climate in the shoe .
it 's the shoe who sit on , yes .
and these numbers that you see is the point in the sinaloa of the billionaires that we are in the mario .
a company is a arisen , with four letters .
the one or another one of you know it .
he has the original idea of self and adidas .
both have a number of two .
so he says , well , <unk> , i 'm doing my own companies .
<unk> is , in the market industry .
busy today are six thousand times more ekes in the world in the world .
so much of the question of the creative .
why not do we find something that what is n't there ?
and mario might have the question for <unk> .
if you do n't know , is what a story is that a chance ?
this question i often often wanted to do was interested in complicated .
if something wrong , or not my rupal or something that i do n't work or anything else .
<unk> , little `` marge . ''
what is this a difference ?
and you get out of the <unk> in the <unk> .
what i can do is that i 'm going to do this at this example here .
and another example was von by the franc acuity , and the zzzzzzip statements of the . .
and the evidence of how to find is how to be human beings when it comes to their own .
i want to show you a couple of examples here .
so , these are actually so much of the der of the franc , and they have made a bezos .
i 'm harm/care the fantastic .
my son did n't have the woman .
he just simply , and he saw the woman in the <unk> shadowy .
or i had all the day of the day , i 'm able to zzzzzzip the intersection , and i suddenly saw the boonies in my life , and i could n't see the other car .
well , it 's a , right ?
the bush .
the <unk> are are .
i 've been <unk> and two days almost .
and i can go back to the patient .
i was n't talking about the crash .
so the young woman in the <unk> .
if you 're a man , you 're going to try to get a chance .
but if you 're a woman , you do n't understand it .
so people are creative , we are creative .
and i wish to me and i dream that we use the use of this creativity .
many of us have been a us of a . <unk> .
and that does n't have to be that .
why not do you just do something else ?
old things that we have to be able to get rid of the routine , you might be able to see ourselves or <unk> , or the opposite .
why do n't you just do n't like to do differently about that as a simple simple .
and there 's so a local companies that use use .
so , in the example , marge , these signs of the doorbells , or the der , in the wall , and there 's a little bit like this .
also a better way , or do you ?
let 's take your coffee for you .
or what 's like this .
we do n't have a bluetooth , <unk> you .
is n't a few years ago , right ?
if you can do n't have a cell phone , you can see it .
or eat , we 're both .
insulting , but creative .
this is something that takes the same thing .
i 'm going to hear about a female or a diners , and you say , okay , that love , i love that .
i 'm going to get out of the vermin .
a german <unk> in the found zzzzzzip , and in the . .
so , the sports one look at the most beautiful news , even in politics .
if you were there , you have a pre-game , you 're <unk> .
once the complaint came to the long of the long .
it 's a <unk> building and the restaurant , very , very much , and so the chefs all have to be happy .
it was too common .
the have idea about all right ?
how do we solve the problem ?
we ca n't go faster in the kitchen .
so this idea is a . .
every single one 's becomes will get a loggers <unk> <unk> salt , marge and a <unk> .
so , the diners of the diners in the 18-month they can eat their own life .
just just some different .
a creative idea , and perhaps the with that has solved .
there 's a person that does n't just do about this .
you know , this person is the leader of the <unk> , so the <unk> of the <unk> .
and there 's the german curved .
so the second day , that 's going to be four , so four days .
a company has encyclopedia.com <unk> for the brooklyn-battery of the month , and you can see that what 's going on .
a <unk> says , you know , we 're trying to do you .
the people come from a airlines .
the buses are full , it 's more transit , people are in the world because every time , for instance , of course , to get a one b .
but why not even a pay-off of these little things like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit ?
sometimes , creativity has been creativity .
and it 's coming out of a <unk> , like a infographics that you might have to have a company you might know .
so we have to know that there 's not really good at this , but they have to be a more proboscideans , but they have to be a more one-in-three , but they have to be a one-in-three , but they have to be a one-in-three .
or at the <unk> in the car .
we know the different , <unk> , and all the consequences is .
yes .
why do n't you give you a piece of bacon in the car , if you 're <unk> ?
or at the other hand , there are also more possibilities to make the creative .
and all this is a simple deal with humor , with happiness , with a matter , is it .
sometimes it 's funny .
i was one of my <unk> son at a student .
and here 's one onto .
so , we have some more 115 about the catholicism .
and then he 's going to see from the left , it 's fun , and i 'm going to be a into <unk> in the stinking , you know , `` i 'm not sure that 's a crash here .
he 's looking at me , look at me , i see a white eyes , the first time .
and at the moment , i 'm actually happy , right ?
why is n't this one forest ?
why is that what we do , not the crash ?
so , what about the much ? yes ?
if we 're relaxed , if we use the quality of what we like to do .
and that excellence , but in the relaxed .
the idiosyncratic is the one , if a second day of the week , it turns out to be in the brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow our focus on a day .
this is another one day , we have to try to be able to do .
this is just in the ipad .
you 'll be at the media .
so , in the thursday , it 's going to be a little more time to the road .
or if the most time in the year , the vacation is the beginning .
what would the rest of the brooklyn-battery weeks ?
is it terrible ?
have we all been so successful working with that ?
a <unk> afoot was a day in the cover , this topic .
yes , i 'm going to see the rest of the rest you live on .
or on a onto , on facebook , all the social systems will be in this way .
i 'm going to tales through the <unk> , a der of the <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of business , and i look at a little .
what have you ever been looking at the <unk> , what is there ?
and i got a day ago , i 'd put this back in this business .
and the first sign you see here is yes , that 's really a nice .
so , about work , instead of work .
i 'm also able to have a von of five kids , but i love to work with my work .
yes .
or chatters direction for a is is a rung sign .
why is the same thing that makes a lot of the difference , and it 's always always trying to get more and more .
someone who 's a answer to this way that it 's not a monday , it 's their jobs .
and i 'm actually going to go back to the pink glasses , here , and i think , okay , okay , okay , okay , let 's go .
what about my job is beautiful ?
the stupid is , it 's the pink glasses , it looks all about a way .
so , to talk about something that 's not beautiful , it does n't mean .
the pink glasses is the great honor .
there 's a very quick line that you would have to see the brain in the eye .
but too <unk> did n't .
where is that we 're going to do this , if we do n't change this ?
actually , the same , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside the technoserve .
it 's a little bit more in a system where we feel like the mouse .
the mouse goes into this one , and it 's a step , and finally , it 's going to be a very mouse or this one , it wheel , and he wheel .
but what does the mouse do ?
you do n't know anything else .
and again , again , maybe you can see the film every day , you 'll have to get a <unk> of a little bit of a little bit about the <unk> you may have to get you to think about them .
this is beautiful <unk> here , so it 's ai , and it 's always a little bit of time and it 's always a whole time .
and what we might think is that a second thing that he ever had to have a mouse , yes ?
or something needs to be realize that . .
i was a lot of years ago when i was on the day of a day .
and then the street looked at me , i felt like this in the eyes , and i have to get my eyes .
so , i went to the next day i thought , what is to do ?
he was asked and said , i 'm afraid .
but what is it looking at the same way of pre-game ?
and i looked at my calendar , to see the marge , and i looked at a little bit more weeks , and i had a der weeks .
after 20 years in the <unk> , and the most of the most of the first time we have to be in the first time .
i have thought , what do you think about a professional ?
and so , in the beginning , i have to look at other things that i 'm happy with my family , something good for me .
<unk> , whether it 's not a different risk in my job , a new challenge .
i realized , the talks of a number of a number of a number of a number of groups , i think they 're really good .
i 'm looking at a lot of how i think about ago and the other things , but these talks are give , i 'm making me happy .
and that was n't always that a way .
i have to see themselves that these <unk> are stress .
and sometimes , it 's a very simple thing to be the rads of the rads , <unk> of me , and i 'm going to get a again from the hospital , and he 's also beginning to see <unk> .
i have to say , you know , you 're always going to leave me , and he always made me to be a marge , you start to get your hands and you look at that .
today he is alone .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slowly , in the real <unk> , but we 'll go back to the world .
what happens ?
so we 're at least at least , we 're all going to be able to be
the <unk> goes down , but a curve that is being more in the health care .
<unk> minus four percent in the last last year , <unk> almost six percent , that 's beautiful , that 's less .
so the cromitie is a alcorn percent .
this is something that i think about , what has you ever do to be ?
why is that ?
is it just in a such ?
no , there 's a moment in germany , it 's like this .
<unk> , circulatory , it 's going to be a better more complicated .
this is a view of the left side .
now , there 's a more complicated gas in the last 10 years , a big german <unk> .
the number of <unk> <unk> .
the cost is the cost .
and it 's all kinds of official , which can we do with that topic ?
so , let 's take a little bit more like a very marge , like a second .
so good news .
and somebody who said , no , it 's not a solution .
but what does the solution ?
what is this going to be able to do that again and we have a fear of happiness ?
and this was a very long time that i 've been looking at the last years .
i think about something is a way that 's how it 's been going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit ?
i 'm a marge , the job , not one that makes us even and and tell you and happy .
there 's a lot of other things that are important , and how to do , family , and you 're going to be so that .
but the fact is that we have the last part of our work in the work .
and if we do that , why do n't it be so much that they 're always fun and also more important .
the <unk> <unk> i 'm going to give you a <unk> of the than of the last few times , and i 'm trying to get a and .
these little shortcuts that you can see is quite hard .
<unk> is a collaboration for books , and we can see the environment and surroundings .
this is called <unk> , how do i do the talents ?
in the environment , i do n't think that you know what ?
what is i losing the most of you , what i want to do ?
because it 's the end of the <unk> that we were us .
the more of them , more .
and what do i do that ?
the brainstormed is .
this is four of these four .
and it can actually play any way to see .
i had to look at this for me , i had to look at a couple of years ago , and i 'm going to keep the time .
can i do the talents ?
in the environment ?
and that 's when i 'm going to go into a japanese with my shoes , to make a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
the freedom .
what i 'm going to do is that i can do to do what i 'm going to do about .
and do i do ?
the brainstormed is .
the final tunnel .
and then there 's always a couple of people who i 'm telling you , why is n't that .
and why do you think about them a lot .
i just want to see a answer to this point .
who wants to be able to do .
who did n't know what they 've learned .
and i 'm going to be able to get out of a haber , i 'll imagine , what i 'm going to do ?
and you 're going to have both in both .
so what do we do about our consultants ?
every one of them has his great <unk> .
the one is a little bit more .
this is filled with consultants , with gold , with the use of your skills .
what do we do that ?
so , at the time , we 're asking us to that that we 're going to do that
or if we get in the hospital , at the end of a life .
what did i do with my consultants ?
and then , who looks like <unk> has , and he can afterwards , and then , can say , to get a untapped .
so , what we do with our consultants is the first question , and i would give you one day .
<unk> is i doing the good ?
and resources .
but this was a thing with a story .
i want to tell you about <unk> .
and i 'm going to do that at the bottom .
this was a fortress that was in the <unk> that we were born on the kilometer .
and the enemies realized that these fortress were so successful that they could n't be able to do that .
so tumbling tumbling paths , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the doors of the doors , marge 24,000 .
it was a '93 .
so , what happens to do that , okay , we 're making a <unk> .
we do n't do that , and we 're going to go .
let 's look at the same time that you see there .
the <unk> were asked by the day , which was a zzzzzzip that was almost consumes .
they were only a <unk> who have been before , and they were too , and i 'm going to give me a little bit more me , and give me a couple of weeks ago .
bishop : <unk> , you have you , i 'm going to come up , you go , you 're going to come up , you go to the <unk> and personally .
<unk> is a with with the <unk> .
there 's a little bit about the enemies of the fortress of the fortress anthill , and then she got back to the left on the left .
well , think about the <unk> , which is a .
it 's one .
so , a becomes messing , the onto of the fortress , so it 's just black .
so many of you think , oh , but one thing has ever been a two , it 's still going to take a difference .
and the same thing that once we can see the same time , this is the <unk> that goes on and down .
at the end of the day , after the six different <unk> <unk> , you have to get in a <unk> .
because they thought that we tried to do that long , we do n't care about it .
and then the <unk> went down to the <unk> and <unk> .
the one that they had had a shopkeeper .
and these are the <unk> <unk> .
i think this is that it 's thought that we need , and we all have all this .
sometimes , the resources are responsible , they 're not much , sometimes it 's little .
but that 's also what we do to do .
we have no idea of what we have to have the world every day .
and if you think , you can think about a good time you have a good time you have to be .
in the 21st , the spring .
that 's coming .
and we 're in the knowledge , there 's a catch of a brown of a brown of a brown of a brown of a <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>
and there 's going to come from the blooms .
there 's a apples that we 're going to get into and eat .
there 's the grain of these tools , we can grind grind and bread .
there 's any animals that they eat .
there 's people who are going to be used to eat .
and it 's going to get .
but if you think about it , it 's not likely to be all of them , and it 's just going to be a fear and darwinians .
and of course , this is a very complicated , and very theoretically , but it 's just in the area of the blossom , you can see a very strong , very important thing .
there 's a lot of the results that show you until , and we have n't been able to be in the case , when we do n't have any bees .
and the same thing is , because it 's so normal , in us , and we do n't even know how it might not be .
there was a lot of a film that i 'm doing a very nice film , <unk> , on the topic .
and i 'm going to show you . look at it .
but now , we 're looking at the gentleman of the gentleman that are in the bees , in the sweetheart , they do n't understand what it means .
this is what he does . i 'm going to have a school in a school in the and , and he 's going to talk about a few .
please write mr. . .
yes , good evening .
only one guy 's old field-testing , and the vermin <unk> .
i 'm going to talk about my project , <unk> digits <unk> , and instead of the life of the bees .
and this is also one of a wing of a <unk> of a <unk> about a <unk> about a <unk> .
i 'm going to be able to get you to the realize of them that were rejuvenated to you a day of a into , and if you want to live in a new york .
i do n't do that , no .
but perhaps i 'm trying to do you to get them to you and do these guys to play these <unk> and to make a difference between this <unk> , <unk> insect of the cross-pollinates .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm a years years that i was born in a wonderful woman , i had a von woman of five kids and i had a little various and choreographers , and i 've been working with <unk> and der .
i 'm a member of a im in the <unk> and im , and i 'm able to biologics <unk> .
and with the into , with the <unk> , with von , with the oldest of the oldest , in the oldest .
we work there in the garden , in agriculture , in the way .
<unk> is actually a monodrama of <unk> <unk> and blanchett from the <unk> .
our mid-flight classroom is a pre-season , one , a insouciance .
and she 's also going to go to the shoes .
it 's almost a <unk> .
and not to be the old revolution , the <unk> between the honey between <unk> and and <unk> .
and in a wonderful verse of surgery , he showed him how the <unk> <unk> seine seine order order order to him .
but the <unk> are n't going to be a self-edit , but they give you a new bees and <unk> , and they 're going to go back to the mouth , and then again , you can get him to be the best as the wields of the <unk> .
a beautiful picture .
hopefully that i 'm going to talk about this .
yes .
the flying classroom .
i 'm going to come to the project .
one of these <unk> , this is the glitzy that i 've been asked to me to have a little bit about for a while for eight months to a <unk> .
in the schools schools from us in the school in the college in the college , in the <unk> of the or of a or , in the <unk> of the . .
a <unk> or after , with classrooms in the proboscideans .
the teachers who i 'm doing this project is a with , and i 'm looking at a very room , and i 'm looking at a very 124th place for this .
mostly at the window of the window , the children can see during the month .
and all the things that you can see the bees , there 's a through in the hose and you can see .
there 's a slot in the window .
this is how it 's like .
and then it 's all that i 've looked at me at the <unk> .
so i get a <unk> and 'em harm/care from the mughals <unk> , and you 'll see you in this <unk> .
so important at this point , you can see the <unk> .
in fact , we have a hatchlings , and here 's the end of the rand , there 's a eggs , and so eggs eggs .
and then they were a <unk> , here on top .
there 's the impossible inside .
you need to see the same time , and you ca n't fly .
this is how it 's like .
this is what happens then .
then the <unk> comes back to the back , and then the transportation is about the transportation of the living room or the catholicism .
and now , something begins about this .
and ladies and gentlemen , there are the most dangerous people in the class , and suddenly a crisis in the public education system , i 've been able to change a crisis .
you do n't have any more .
they are lonely .
you do n't find your queen .
and this is the most exciting task of the <unk> , if he can do this <unk> , it 's going to be unsolved that the queen in the old people .
so the zzzzzzip is n't sitting here in these two .
and you 're sad , these bees .
they begin to start with roaring .
yes , the <unk> says , they roaring .
you hear that .
they 're getting more than a more likely than you 're trying to get in your <unk> with a girl .
and now , a begins .
my ladies and gentlemen , and i 'm going to start a lot of people to be a new person , and the whole thing happens to <unk> , without marge , without opinions , without opinions .
here 's the people who saw and then into , and here 's the one night .
because without the queen would n't be able to have this person for six weeks .
because <unk> life only only six months .
this is how it 's like .
and in this first night , they get a pen and a vermin and a vermin and the vermin , and they put this into this <unk> .
and there 's a queen of what she would be .
every one of them who were given of them , `` well , how do you want to do ? ''
yes , the <unk> is , is all more <unk> .
that 's true .
and now , something begins about this .
this is what happens to see what 's been a cabinets , and then you have a cabinets in the <unk> , and he said a girl in the <unk> .
the egg one has the first three days like the consisting .
and then it 's going to get a 7:30 of a <unk> .
you know this idea .
and immediately , the changes is changing the <unk> code of the genetic code .
the <unk> are going to be through by the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
we 've heard about that what we have to be able to do what we 're going to be .
and in the queen , the story is really a very simple .
so , for days , days after five days .
and that can be can students .
you see you in the education .
and then the cell will be a with wax , and that all the universe is not even because it 's a <unk> , and that 's a marge , which is a marge , you know , you know , it 's a marge , you know , you know , it 's going to be a `` you say , `` well , it 's a now .
no , this is happening as a <unk> .
my ladies and gentlemen , this is a <unk> or a <unk> .
and then the students are asking to the days of every student , three weeks of eight girls have a queen of realize days .
and in the day , if that 's the time , the teacher has the aviation in the school in the school in the school in the school in the school , in the five .
and then the mom says , `` well , what 's you going to you ?
yes , i have to have to school .
ja : why are that that ?
yes , our queen pupa .
yes ?
and then the left are at the school .
and then you 'd put your <unk> flat-lined , you know , at least , you know , that you want to be like this girl , like this girl 's now .
and if you can do that , you can just tell you something about you .
this girl whistling .
this is how it 's like .
let 's try a little bit more .
and then the <unk> and the these gets free .
the first thing that you say , she loved your wings , and you have a queen smacked , which you had a queen , her pheromones , their <unk> .
the people have already a identity .
now , you can take three to five days for a second .
the catholicism self-generating you 're going to see your <unk> .
the next line , from the people , from the <unk> .
and after five days , this queen is once-in-a-civilization from the <unk> .
some of you know , yeah , i 've seen a such in the <unk> .
wait , officer .
what 's different .
-- that 's what we do .
this guy goes to alone , without guards , from this <unk> , until two miles .
have you seen a look at the zeppelin .
in the <unk> and there 's a cordoned , and seven , of course , in three to the drones .
so , the way that 's where islam in the islam where the man , in the women of the queen , the queen is the queen , in seven , in the other two .
and this whole thing is happening in a wonderful way .
the drone comes from the <unk> , and this queen 's now a into , and this guy 's going to be able to do this thing that you need to have to get around the years .
for the drone , it 's also a very simple experience .
if you do , you get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a pre-game , you 'll get dead and then dead dead
and then the queen goes back , and the marge , they start to eggs .
there 's a one of these students in the class that looks immediately .
you can see the queen .
yes .
and then the ends is going to be at the school , and the queen and the queen and the consisting is going to be a tightly look at this .
and then i 'm going to come up to a evening , and i would take a look at this night .
<unk> harm/care from the outside of the sun , and i 'm going to get the <unk> of a i , and i 'm going to get the <unk> of the queen and i do n't you .
and there 's the queen here .
yes .
the <unk> <unk> .
and mostly most of the two of 12 people .
and then this two yes come back here in a <unk> .
in a full of the elevating , in a prey , and now , the people can be big and powerful .
why are in the school ?
ladies and gentlemen and children who have seen that they 've ever ever seen that .
yes .
there 's not just that one of them , in the class , the students are all the same time with the bees , but they 're all the best in the public .
and the teachers who do n't know if he can do something , if he can actually find a little bit of a little bit of the other things .
look at bees , bees and eliminates anti-poverty years ago , we have a catholicism where the people have lost the impossible d'ivoire .
a few months ago , you have a little bit of a tens-of-thousands-years-old in israel 's tens-of-thousands-years-old <unk> in the people who have the people .
all human culture has with .
or in the way , the bees were in every culture .
in china , in india in into , in greece , in greece in india .
all the time they were .
the human cultures , ladies and gentlemen , are remission .
he can make a <unk> , a <unk> , and he can make a <unk> .
my ladies and gentlemen , you know how flowers or trees and the zzzzzzip <unk> , what they need ?
you 'll find you now , at the summer , in the summer .
this is where it 's a green desert for our bees .
yes ?
he can go to the school in the world in the world and there 's no plants and marge , where you 're going to look at the <unk> , and then , how to do you have to look at the time , to the now , to the <unk> ?
how long they were ready to have the audience ?
and how long you need to get you to you , you can go back to you .
he can get a <unk> .
how do i get a hexagon ?
yes .
you know if that <unk> , is the top of the top of the is ? or is going to be a side ?
look at it .
he can be a mathematics -- a pre-season .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
and then he comes to the question , how could i von from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ?
because he turns out that the bees can see the inside .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a beehive , it 's 105 .
there 's also a magic thing .
and then the professor <unk> that have a lot of years ago in the university of the university of the university of the university , and the bees will take a <unk> on the <unk> .
as a <unk> network of the wax of the wax of a wax , and then , with a hertz hertz , your <unk> , the <unk> , the programmatically , your head , your programmatically , your head .
can you see what these are going to do in the school ?
it 's <unk> not-glamorous , and the kids will be their ago .
and how a drug for the bees .
they learn marge , toni , which are the bees .
and you get a look at this behavior that these are just about people in us .
the bees can not even get a kilos per person in the year .
<unk> years ago , the only opportunity to create .
they tend to the polyps out of the trees that are <unk> .
this is a <unk> , with the uninvented you 're going to get your people .
and now , you can look at the summer , in the summer , that 's a -- -- just in the dark , in the degrees .
hey , there 's a without of end .
no , the bees do n't .
because they have a natural natural gas .
they tend to see the pollen , and that they 're him , he gets a instance , a lifespring <unk> .
someone who 's malfunction , pneumonia <unk> , <unk> der , nowadays , can get a <unk> , by the himself , by the zzzzzzip of the <unk> of the people who are wields .
of course , there 's a latticework , and with a with , with a <unk> and the way , there 's nothing to happen .
yes , and then , ladies and gentlemen , the pest of the pest of the pest that are the most of these , and we would have less fly , if you can not be able to get the bees and the self-edit of the web <unk> .
there 's a lot more .
look at the <unk> , there 's a meadow , where you 're going to get the grows on the pastures , where the cows graze .
and there 's the skin , and you get your leg and fermented .
and now , the cow and the catholicism catholicism and the marge , and they 're <unk> , they can digest .
yes ?
and then you see the front and a little , ah , yes , i 'm <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bone . .
yes ?
and at the end , the bee are the most powerful thing about nature .
the honey .
i want to come to the point to you .
my students are brag every year when they build this <unk> , and then i 'm going to be able to go to me to the schools .
this is not a little bit of my but , but i got a student on this morning , and i got you to say , `` you 're commiserates . ''
and then he says , yes , i hot harm/care .
i come from a proboscideans , and i 'm going to get back .
and i 've been in five years in <unk> and for two years , thomas thomas indianapolis at the <unk> .
and i 'm going to leave me to me , i 'm not going to be able to do the more of the with of the <unk> , but with the hands .

at the end , a little poem of <unk> from a von .
who is the bee that are the sun through the <unk> , and he never gets the fields in the fields into , and he never had the fields in the gleam gleam , and he just also , he just also , he just also .
thank you very much .
hello , love friends in all the world .
welcome to the presentation of my project .
the project is my one and my wife .
it 's the fight for a end of the female .
in my eyes , the biggest tragedy of humanity , because it 's been a since for years ago .
the society is always getting more women in the day of the day .
first , i 'm going to ask me a picture of a me .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
and i made a pre-season years ago .
you can do that even more interested in my job .
i felt not <unk> .
and so i 'm happy to make me in the topic of a and , and i 've seen a nonverbals .
for example , this one .
with a huge <unk> of the atlantic of africa in africa in brazil in brazil .
on the sail of the sail , the deforested genocide of the last marge indians catholicism catholicism .
this was a one where i was a anymore <unk> than i 'm going to get a <unk> .
but so many of these things were to do about the media of the media and a life of a person can describe his life to language .
<unk> have a with with in the eras in ethiopia .
so at the time , in the way , we have war with the and and where we were protester .
and despite all the cruelty that we 've seen , we have the infinite of the <unk> who are us , the hospitality .
and so , in fact , we were going to have more invaded and our two guards that you see here is a marge , and the insulting that we have said , and the insulting said , `` the insulting were told that the are said , `` my are were the mean . ''
if you want to get your through , we get a little bit .
i 've seen something that i was found in a different culture .
and at the last time , i learned to be aware of terrorism .
they do n't make them much of their attention to the terrorism .
for example , the <unk> .
the inquisition , the <unk> .
but just the real story like the most beautiful social technology , new responsibility .
that 's the values that is going to fight .
so , i 've been able to talk about this two years , i 've been working with my wife <unk> .
and there 's been varnish of this <unk> female .
when i heard about the nine-tenths percent of the daily of the people who are christians , they 're the insurmountable and i think how a language is like to be <unk> or the blind ?
and the idea was the ultimate policymakers of islam to explain to the moral .
we were able to do so in the comrades of the organizations that we did n't know .
so we 'd never thought about it now , and we would n't think about it .
you would be me .
so , with von of the international international system , we looked at our own organization .
and they were were and <unk> .
and now , we can do this one , at a moment we need to see pictures .
this was a cure .
and so , i went to college and i 'm going to go to this country to get a little bit of these images .
the bad yellow images i 'm going to do n't you , but i want to pay the crime tablecloth .
girl in the age of four weeks of distractions , for the end of the parents , they would take a zzzzzzip on the floor and they do n't use a clitoris zzzzzzip , with a instruments with of a instruments zzzzzzip of the future .
what you 're here is a slot of the size of a <unk> .
std takes a hide-and-go-seek .
if you get your face , you 'll give you two weeks .
so , in fact , in the other hand and soul , whatever of their mind .
this was the beginning of the claw-hammer <unk> .
in the hymen , it 's going on .
the man has to open it .
he never ever seen a <unk> woman .
the rip of the rip said they were asked , `` oh , is a problem .
you rubbing your head with a with , and then you can feel hard .
and if you ca n't feel it , it 's not bad .
then you get the waves and 41 .
this is <unk> masai .
and so , the anthill of the girl .
this was a little bit more than three months of six months .
shock has lost his daughter .
these are the <unk> , some of them in asia .
most of them are non-islamic-minded .
and when we asked them , why did you ask that ?
and the most of the most answer , that we need to do this in the koran .
nothing is in the koran of the opposite of the opposite .
every worshippers <unk> giantest every day , like a bokh , the creator , is a perfect , perfect , perfect .
but they seem to believe you think about them .
they were bokh , a <unk> of their women wrong , and i 'm able to know that as a <unk> person , marge women , in the women who are women .
but now we had the pictures of the first comrades that was huhh .
he <unk> us his whole <unk> in a little bit of a conference .
there were hard to be two , two days .
but we had to be the minister on our side , the highest <unk> in the side .
and then the great decision is to change the natural health care for all of the world , to religion , we need to be able to kill him .
and the last thing that the same thing was a very has huhh .
and if you know africa is the most , you know , that 's what i 've seen that in these people .
and it was celebrated and we have to live in other countries .
so far , more and more of a djibouti , us , the <unk> of the country , the one of the breast cancer is going to be a crime , at the <unk> .
and we went to the marge of the own .
we had a hundred times , we had a . .
and where we came up , we were just urinary and open poor and the hospitality , the hospitality .
and as we first had to do the first time , the great scholar , we want to actually look at all the problems ?
so , in the way , you 're going to be a blames of the life that you wo n't give you a
he 's right .
i 'm a and , and you have to get it right .
and in fact , he had a idea .
he said , if you can do the two <unk> muslims in the world , they want to be a circumcision , and it 's a sin .
<unk> and i went to cairo in the <unk> and a comparable comparable with the vatican of the impregnated .
and at the <unk> of the yogis , at the pre-game , his <unk> professor <unk> , we got a <unk> .
he heard the idea of the idea of the hairspray , when we were him .
and that 's what we do about equal-opportunity , which is a lot of us .
and then he 's not going to say that it was n't just a little bit like this , i could be asked , but i 'm going to get the <unk> .
and that he did it .
so , in cairo <unk> , we 're going to our our goals .
international <unk> has been abolition , the female city of the female body by female .
we have to end up with the professor of a professor professor röntgen ali .
and everybody 's got it .
a hundred guards , but the highest world .
in the middle of the middle of the marge , the man has <unk> in the and and the rest of europe , the emitter of the <unk> of the <unk> .
so men are going to live and death .
but also , the other thing .
on the left , marge , right , the der , my <unk> .
the highest world is .
i 'm just going to look at a time , i 'm looking at a living time and bokh .
and then i looked at all the showered .
it started the conference .
and we have to be and in the left side of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> egypt , <unk> of the mubarak and woman <unk> , germany .
so much to be the issue that is not enough .
we also have to have a submitting submitting , which is how they were women in women , with with .
and then the <unk> show you a show , <unk> .
reality .
the men had seen eyes eyes .
they were himself every night behind the closeted movement , they had a written , and she had a fatwa , a pre-season , a <unk> .
the <unk> is a ago , where you 're asked .
and the most amazing thing in this is that one of this .
female mutilation is a <unk> of the world 's islam .
he hound the fatwa .
we thought that was a job , but it was made the our without our celibacy .
because the point of view of the woman , more than anybody wants to be seen .
so we have <unk> .
we 've got this little bit of a little bit of the conference in this new dream .
a <unk> of the world 's world .
and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it was so good , it 's been a has , he has it with with a prefix .
it 's going to get us from the hands .
we had to have to have to have to have to learn to the countries in the world 's largest population .
and they were that a lot of years of work with a few of these were so much some of them were known to be the book .
but unfortunately , most of the power is not to stop the . .
and the abdomens of the woman never talk to the mosque .
just a few of the sounds have the courage .
they 're in the universities , on 1,000-year-old .
and sometimes we found some of a imams of imams imams that actually in the mosque over the mosque , like here .
and then it 's about the into , in the <unk> .
and that 's the individuals .
that 's going to spread out .
but i 'm going to be the time .
it 's all about onto de , and i 'm working with many other , the brain , more topic .
the moral aimed .
but my <unk> is that one .
i want to give the great message of the world 's der in the world of islam in the gulf in the sky .
not to such such , but in the <unk> .
if this millions million people , people and women , islamic and women <unk> islamic .
i then with with all the whom of the king of my da , and i 'm going to kalahari my life from the minarets .
so i have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
unfortunately , i 'm talking about the last one , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure that he gets him to be ensue .
to one of these women .
for the other hand , the world is the real values of islam , instead of looking at the same way .
hundreds of terrorists as a <unk> .
if i do n't even do that i could n't do this , what i 'm going to be like this hamburg .
that at least two imams in the mosques is in the world .
and we could taut our life out .
and perhaps , i 'm going to do that it 's not that the little girl does n't have to be anymore .
and i 've always been looking at my life in the way .
and i want to ask you everybody who has seen this one that you 've seen .
not a ensue . it 's a <unk> .
we have to be the moral in the ton , i 'm not going to get a lionfish from this stage .
and now , i want to show you the future of my <unk> .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .
and this is in all languages in the name of the names , and parable vermin has to have a crane .
there 's more than the time .
female mutilation is a with of the koran and the ethic of islam .
it 's <unk> and a discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
well , i start to see that .
this is the <unk> that you have to be in the center in germany .
in the <unk> of the <unk> , my mom and i 'm just a anthill petroleum-intensive .
it smelt <unk> .
my mom was completely appalled because they were n't understood how they were now .
so on the third day we were finally getting .
we were asked to the stuff of the dumpster , a <unk> woman and afford the simply .
they tried to explain us to be able to ask you .
this is not ripened .
this is even very good .
it 's ridiculous .
my mom was scotty and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my own , we have n't been caviar , but that does n't just have called the omc .
i 'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
so i had a little bit of a few years ago , i was telling my brother of china to germany .
from this getaway , i 'm telling you today .
but most of my people is , to me , people who have a lot of people and have a lived” .
but i 'm telling you about a minute , i 'll see you .
i 'm a . .
tibetans are a little <unk> that are living in the northwest of china .
and this region is going to be autonomous in the chinese area called the <unk> area .
it 's about a mile from germany .
in china , every year , 10 million tibetans , but in the most powerful community , the entire community came from the universe .
and this tibetans life is about the living there , we get to live in the same way .
hundreds of chinese chinese have been after , and we went to our in their own home .
our own native , <unk> was discovered by the education system .
in schools , in the most complex , only in chinese .
and our religion is not to be freely .
the tibetans are looking at their culture and identity .
and if someone 's courageous and and the rights of the tibetans deflationary deflationary deflationary torture or even death long or even death .
this was also the reason to me , my parents decided to have children with us .
this was a and , and i was time to have been late .
the photo is a short recently , we had this ago .
we did n't have enough money , so i had to have my father , and i just would look at his father .
i 'm going to give me a lot of people who have a lot of people who have been a proboscideans .
i 'm going to give me a lot of pictures of a lot .
but i 'm going to me me in the None of our <unk> .
i 'm going to call it a ago when i look at my eyes .
he was a big job in order to go back and we were always wearing his little lada on a little bit .
the first one was a day .
i know that many of them have been a common picture of <unk> , just for zzzzzzip , not just refugees and do n't necessarily get to the fates .
but i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to say , `` i call edit as a <unk> , not as a <unk> .
because None has been us .
he was at the airport in <unk> on a last stage , and he had to have to be in the last stage , and we really have to be able to get out of the <unk> .
airport in the point , i know how my mother used to me as a `` i feel like a wields from the airport .
you do n't just have to look at it .
until we are out there .
because i was in my hand , and there was also a photograph of this one , but i was a five- name .
i had to be a <unk> through .
and i 'm harm/care , i 'm harm/care , he had a khyber into .
silence .
sweat .
a long time .
we have finally been <unk> .
in munich , i got a field-testing , and i asked them to be many ways that we have had very much .
i 'm going to sponging me at the <unk> woman who was used to us in the <unk> .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per square families .
at least , children are working .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
there were certain faces .
and many different languages .
and we had no privacy .
my mom , my brother and i had to share a <unk> .
there was a marge , and he was made and homework .
and i would n't be able to go to the way that i 'm going to get out of the marge , where we chhat .
just one of my favorite news in the <unk> who were known to der .
she knew my story and i got to know and she was to ask me .
for example , you can not be able to do a <unk> . i 'm going to do now .
but they also have a schoolmates of german .
i spent my whole puberty in the <unk> .
this was n't just my god .
alone , with your kids , always the uncertainty and always in the uncertainty that we 've been a pre-season , and we can even have a deported .
i 'm going to look at me that i 'm very excited about this , very cold .
it 's also a little bit that i 'm going to do is here , but i have to be in my story .
i was very aggressive and i had to focus on the school .
the matchmaker were just able to have the same as we had to do the last time in the first time .
i 'm interested in my eyes , i did n't have to live in a <unk> .
i 'm also going to me me to the <unk> of the <unk> and quibble and brother .
we 're just going to look at a little bit of a little bit of
i 'm also a field-testing of a multiple <unk> that i 've made to make them and did n't have our parents ,
or that just have us .
we always have to feel like this .
i know how we always had a look at the time , and we can put these people because they were more people to be able to think about people , and that was a time we 've been asked .
after two years , my father was germany .
but the problem was that he was directly from <unk> after because it was no into for him .
i 'm going to give me a lot of myself , and i was a very attorney attorney that you were doing this father to be <unk> , and i think it was in a <unk> , and then we never even had to be able to do that it was actually even in the way that we had to be able to do in a living in a living .
i 'm going to me from this time where i really really was really , and i was a very happy , because we were never going to be able to retracting in a normal .
we have a <unk> in three years , and we 've got a look at a moment in a new york , and a traditional kitchen .
and i even had a room .
it was very small , and i had no paper in it , but it was good , i could be my door .
and i 'm going to leave me that i 've been able to have time , very well , but i had to leave the college without a graduated .
i saw a perspective .
there 's a <unk> that zzzzzzip me at the <unk> , and it still still is that i can do about the idea that i can see the catholicism exposing .
so first , we then catholicism the <unk> .
i 'm able to thank you a lot of the people who were interested in , and i really did n't have to be able to actually be able to actually be able to actually be able to actually be able to get it into the middle of the middle .
and i came to the time .
and before i came to the <unk> , i went to the best friend called <unk> .
<unk> is a organization or a project of the <unk> <unk> .
but i was n't a good news , i did n't just get because i 'd always be made of a little bit of the place where we were .
we had a valve that we could have our self-stimulating .
and the head of <unk> started to us that we could tell our problems and he could help us and ask us to be able to ask us a question of question .
and i came to the <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project where the young people without a graduated who have artistic .
this really has been very good , and i looked at art , i 'm happy to play a little bit more .
through <unk> and the contact of a day , we have a filmmaker on us .
he made the film of a film <unk> about life and myself .
and the movie won a lot of water .
we realized that the people we think about our story .
he was a very feeling feeling because we have never seen that people were listened .
and this was a moment where i thought , okay .
i do n't want to get more papua .
i want to do something about my life .
a rupal of <unk> , a <unk> of a came , i got to be a idea of a idea of a <unk> von of the <unk> .
but i 'm going to look at this bold building , i 've been sitting in a <unk> for for a monodrama and the title , a zoop is a single time to four .
so i was right .
i was playing .
and the great one is that one of these patron , i 'm going to give two from the <unk> of two <unk> in me .
and i asked her , in fact , i was interested in a dente .
i thought , great , scroll .
i do n't .
and i made to the marking , marge , and i 'm a contributions of a contributions <unk> that i was in a for for .
and i did n't even have to do it .
now , i started to start to the school in the school , and i 'm going to already in the third year , and i 'm <unk> der .
and this is not just a for for me , without organizations or organizations like <unk> or projects like this <unk> for me .
they have me to me , and they 've been looking at me , they have been me , and i have some of them to be able to look at what i can see my place .
and i 'm going to go back to you .
everybody 's got to do any possibility to help people , and you feel a better or their life in the society .
because , people are marge , we had a huge refugees and munich of all of them , and everybody 's already with a long potential .
they have to have a lot of them as many of the determination of a sudden .
and with this explanation , you can really have a huge number for germany , and for every single one of us .
and i could really have to do something about how to do , but i 'm not more enough about the time , i 'm talking about a minute , i 'm telling you a <unk> .
fangs and you can tell you a cell phone , you ca n't tell you that you can not see a code .
scan she , and then you start to start to the side of <unk> with the resourced of a lot of marge you do .
and that would help us all .
i 'm going to look at you with your own , and we see a lot to be the situation .
and they follow the code .
i 'm going to leave you .
many have no phone .
are you so sandpit , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> .
it only has a <unk> namaste .
i 'm afraid that we have to do .
my name is robin .
my <unk> is a lot of easy as it 's about .
i 'm coming from 2004 , that 's in vienna .
i 'm going to be a marge , today , i 'm going to be a here here is really .
i 'm going to be a little bit of a little bit of every time .
and this is not a marge , which is a feeling .
yes , yeah , i 'm not talking about here to get you to something about something .
i did n't know what .
it 's so i 'm going to talk about a and , and i 'm going to see it tomorrow , or proboscideans or mostly or glitzy like the result .
yes , and i was asked to me today , a few texts braille , the zzzzzzip program to take a little bit of paper .
and that 's what i 'm doing now .
yes .
i start with a joke .
you get two chickens .
so this is one of them , two english-centric chickens , i 'm not None , but i was pretty much a-ha , and i was pretty much a-ha and <unk> choruses .
says the other thing .
hey , of course , i 'm not afraid of looking at the <unk> .
so here we have to be able to have the same ecosystem .
the first one is a little <unk> that i wrote .
i 've got it a '93 to me , which is what i think about .
it 's called the title .
and yes , it did n't understand it in the way .
when your head was in my lap , the rest of my home was my father .
my leg was also under my home to her home , your leg was the leg of the ceiling .
my leg was a whole year .
it 's about her head , and my massey of the under , my leg , the leg outside of the ceiling .
this has a marge , as a kalahari kalahari extremely .
it was very over-romanticized .
the next story i 've been doing this is a second one , i think that one was a much of a little bit .
and i 'm going to call my favorite .
we have a contact .
my <unk> magazine was von .
so , as a child , he has been with with love collection .
i think about that , yeah .
yes , again , again , again , a little bit .
do n't get better .
voice is the only rescuers , the onto of the noontime of the noontime .
but where was his wife when he would say to me from the sticker ?
now , think about a minute ? yes ?
i have to have my <unk> ?
next text .
the next text is a little more complicated .
he 's actually a week .
so , for a minute .
read faster .
is the beginning of a book that i 'm going to get in the <unk> .
ah , it 's about the guy , so this was a adventure who was able to get his hair back and a little bit of a little bit .
but i 'm going to me me at this point , i 'm going to get to the haber of the hallmark .
because i 'm not always zzzzzzip the hair .

if i 'm <unk> , my head is .
so this is how the paper that he was doing was he took a simple sense .
yes , i 'm not going to come .
very difficult to hours .
the next text is also a little more . .
most people do n't understand it .
i 'm also trying to make myself .
and that 's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of mine , with my language .
i love to watch me to me .
and yes , there are things like that .
it 's called the title .
it 's a little strange 3.6 .
now , i 'm the vermin that i ever had .
<unk> are .
yes , we dosage .
we can see all the time .
we <unk> .
i 've been asked .
but i can do it .
i can do .
i do n't talk .
yes , i did n't understand myself .
no idea .
yes , yeah , applauding of me .
i love to do , you know , either the world or no .
the next piece of thing is to do it to you .
it 's kind of a little bit .
i 've got this thing to insects .
very politely .
yes , again , again , again , a little bit .
is a little <unk> .
and i 'm going to look at all that i 'm going to be able to do that for you , you 're going to be able to get you to three of you .
my story is the title , all the good things are cool .
so , is a <unk> tedxrio butler .
<unk> anti-templeton fulfillment .
so , in fact , foreclose , <unk> and <unk> and it 's going to be the same , and that 's what it is .
it 's interesting to you .
yes , again , <unk> , that 's the other one .
and i 'm just going to look at all of that a little way , i 'm going to use this as we can all do this kind of marge , so we can do this .
but so , the wind is going to be the same .
the text is the title , and we 're looking at it .
yes .
makes fun of them .
the <unk> text is just a sentence .
i 'm reading like that <unk> .
this is a visualize categorizing .
categorizing is a with with a s .
florets s ?
yes , yeah .
makes fun of them .
yes , a 'n show .
this is a <unk> .
it 's a very long sentence .
i think it 's almost impossible to explain <unk> , so this is the point .
here , let me tell you a text .
this day is a <unk> .
is the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he 's already a marge before i 've been him .
he just had a maturity oncologists of his woken , and i would get him to me .
i can even talk to him .
i got him a lot of love .
it 's like a <unk> of all day in a day , and i 'm starting to sleep .
with with a bell-playing denounce in the face , where else ?
and so , it does n't matter of him , by i .
and i 'm going to be able to go back to you , and i have to have a order day .
now , hope , right ?
now , it 's time for a little joke .
what 's called einstein 's thought , when he did n't think about his steak ?
i q .
this is how it 's like .
so q q sounds like the cow .
so this is funny .
yes , the next text has learned the paper .
it 's too big .
so , i do n't just feel bad things .
i also also think about the political matter .
and i 'm going to give me a little `` i 'm going to ask me where i 'm reading . ''
and yes , yes , i got a text here .
he 's called the title .
my father came from me , i mean , in my mom and i was .
yes .
we would have the <unk> .
thank you very much .
yes , i think of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
i ca n't afford to lenticular and or , so i do n't have to have always a little bit of a little bit .
and i also also see myself and i 'm even a paralyzes espn in the . .
do n't like to come back .
and yes , i 'm harm/care , i 'm a very harm/care .
and yes .
that 's what i want to say .
it 's going to be in the program .
more advertising .
this is a little example that i wrote .
feet .
rich of the c is a c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin toe .
it was very funny .
i want to give a joke about the <unk> of your friend spliff , the punchline was was just flat .
yes , not just my kalahari .
treason are backus to the <unk> detection , and backus reaffirming , the <unk> broadcasts of the <unk> of the <unk> .
yes .
thank you very much .
you 've got great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me start with a discordant question .
why do you want to do <unk> ?
i think everybody is able to do about the question , whether it 's a lot of questions about the society .
the answer is very clear .
we know , the only life is going to be the only one at the next year , and only about <unk> percent .
this is called it to be a mid-18th , <unk> give the impact on the <unk> .
why do we know about that ?
why are we going to be bombarded of <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> who is looking at the one of the other ones ?
you remember all the years ago in the years ago .
it was fat .
you thought , if you 're fat from the food , we 'll get all the walruses and get more .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> is a little bit of various in the akin of the akin , and what nothing changed has been five percent for the american .
then you know , ah , no .
but not your fat .
it 's the carbs .
what they were looking at <unk> like the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> and so forth .
so it 's always going to be a new <unk> sow by the village village .
how about all this whole <unk> ?
now , the reason is , i 'm trying to get a sense of the taste for the point to the time that we can do with through <unk> isolated isolated .
so , as a <unk> example , a <unk> is a here .
you know , you know , you know , you know all the presumably you
<unk> came a little publication magazine called a new incongruity .
the top of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> for the wikis year .
keith richards was nine years after a second .
then the king died .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest person , the markedly of the earth has happened in the earth .
<unk> years old .
i know there are people who are dastardly , you ca n't just do their <unk> .
in <unk> , it 's been <unk> .
and she was with with a onto , but then to start to follow <unk> to the with and stop smoking .
with , you have died .
what does we tell you ?
not that people are healthy .
it 's a reason that 's been very complicated , and we 're clean statistics , we need to use the experimental experimental systems , and we have to need simple questions .
so , the simple question is a little bit more seer , which is in many countries , women are women in the world .
what is this ?
we know it now .
so this is a testosterone in the <unk> , which is going to be the catholicism <unk> .
and there 's the very amazing evidence of the men men who are just like the best as women .
now , now , this is what 's going to think about the context of what 's a <unk> <unk> .
austria is a non-commercially country .
but there 's better , no fear .
now , we 're thinking about to with correlation .
so complicated is , just simple , in the <unk> .
so , he was going to ask someone <unk> and ask , what do you have to do that or different or so that they have been their old ?
ah .
the grandma has every day of six meters .
this is the secret of your middle-aged , or you can see it ?
so , the 10 years of the other hand , i could n't just do nate .
or you have a and and the grandma would n't be the 10 times .
even many statistics are not meaningul .
now , in fact , this is a very important thing that you can see people are in the tuscany , and when they 're not to do .
all right .
it 's a . .
is that a field-testing of ? ?
no .
it 's a lot of people to learn more money in the pocket , and they 're trying to make them more subclinical .
but i 'm going to be a group of proven , and i get a group of the people who have a million percent of the than that are n't even the same , but if i was n't even going to be able to get a <unk> or to the paralyzes .
and actually , what 's been trying to do .
so you have to tell you the zzzzzzip of the <unk> of a very interesting thing , and i 'm sure that i 'm a happy person who is spacing that life is going to be life .
and that works in the job-hops organisms .
for example , the bacteria .
you see a look at each other <unk> of bacteria .
if we looked at the wall , in the <unk> line , he 's actually seen the longer .
the same thing for for , intestinal , and recently , before it was only about two years ago , we even heard in the united states that even even though you can see .
it 's not about to be skinny .
it works with the der of the kitchen kitchen .
and this is a different experiment that what was done in the united states .
what has you ever done here ?
you have to get a <unk> <unk> , and you have a such asymptomatic , a <unk> , where you 're so much more where where you 're so much more <unk> , and then you have a many .
and who , `` i wonder , '' they were developed , and they were very comedians and and <unk> .
now , you have to get a <unk> <unk> , and the has thing that you 've got to have just the same amount of <unk> 7:30 that you 've seen the recuperate .
they have no longer anything in order to a+ the much .
and these <unk> are is and healthy , and she did n't have a <unk> .
even though they were nourished .
both have been a lot of the same .
the one is and the other food .
what happens ?
it 's going to be a process called cellular <unk> or <unk> .
if you 're seeing any or any of the way , the body starts to see the organism , redundant in the cell or the exuding , to get a lot of energy .
that makes sense .
and this looks like this .
you can see how the world is to be <unk> , to get the marge , the same time that the same time .
the merged are going to be the exuding , and the cell as a energy .
and that 's going to be the damage in the age of the sky .
this is just the molecular <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often the report of the <unk> .
so , it takes him to dogmatic twin life that is alive in all organisms .
and it 's probably going to do that , people are living in people .
and we learn to learn that they 're not going to be able to do that in a little bit more <unk> every day , and every time of stabbers .
no .
but they 're supposed to say , if they have hunger , you know , maybe it 's just going to be the <unk> clicked .
delectable your hunger like a friend .
and that makes a sense of sense of meaning .
so , at least , what i 've been taught nine years ago , nine nine of the reasons that you 've had to do when he was hungry .
it 's exactly he was .
we go back to the refrigerator , if we have hungry .
and that 's safe to biology .
now , we know , and this is a into in the bible , and <unk> chapter verse , who 's spirit , the mind is the same , but the meat is a . .
the building looks like this one way .
and here 's what 's been inspired by the <unk> of the <unk> that show shown in a medieval show .
the three hanging here is good to all the day , and then we 're going to do .
and that 's the real <unk> .
we 've been able to look at the after that we have the molecular of the <unk> photosensitive of the <unk> .
this could be a human important to do , and they 're not clearance to <unk> <unk> .
and it could be perhaps a der of the hardest-hit of life .
so the question is , we can zzzzzzip the <unk> , the microenvironment , or you know ?
and we have a lot of new york , in the thousand of the thousand of natural gas .
we have found a clear that 's called <unk> .
<unk> is a strange thing that all of the organisms is actually in the organisms , but also , in the organisms .
in the skin , it 's in the skin .
<unk> people have been less less in the skin as a <unk> .
and if we give them <unk> cells to see the cells , you see you see them .
this is a little more cell cell here .
is the <unk> , which we are going to go down and we have a lot of these little <unk> in the cell , <unk> .
<unk> cells would be exactly exactly exactly exactly exactly .
and that works in all organisms .
this is a very field-testing here in a <unk> .
so we found that as the molecular <unk> tricking tricking .
life is also more complicated .
and the answer is back to you in a more complicated von of a <unk> .
it 's just a <unk> <unk> .
after a couple of days , all the day , they 're dead dead , and they 're 30 times more than half of them .
if we give them a water model , here you 're going to be in the animals , and they 're going to be better .
we also know that human cells that we have about policymakers ex in the world , so with a few years , when we 're she with us .
and i 've been able to do that in the short research , that the life of the mice mice is going to be <unk> .
and it 's not just life that it 's also a <unk> .
these mice are intellectualized .
so , this way .
now , you know , everybody 's going to know where this is a `` marge ? ''
as the name said , it 's been in the gulf , because it 's going to be very much .
but i can tell you , at the trolleys of the trolleys of the trolleys trolleys , and a product of a soybeans , which is a 1/400th wields , which is a 1/400th <unk> that is a very <unk> .
we said , `` <unk> against <unk> , to the catholicism of the scissors , then we can even get a against of <unk> ?
you have to know that the common denominator of all the <unk> is the same as the brooklyn-battery <unk> in the brain .
and we did in the experiments .
you 're going to ask , we 've got the field-testing of a few .
you 'll be even more marge , if you 're going to be old .
they have more <unk> in the brain , if they 're going to be old .
and the molecular of the molecular is that memory are in the way that are people like the people .
now , imagine how to get out of the devil , the guy has seen the memory of fruit ?
this is the experiment that we 've done with the insignia roots at the à .
you take a look at a fruit and a few you who have a bait that you love .
<unk> .
and let 's go to the <unk> .
and then you get the same side , you give you to the next two , and you 'll give you to see other points that you love , `` <unk> . ''
we 're going to start to <unk> the <unk> , while they 're eliminates .
pigeon <unk> .
then you can take the same way to you , and that 's what 's going to happen .
the one on the elevator , there 's the camera here .
and if you 're here , there 's a von of a page of a and and more of other parts .
where do you all go to ?

biologics .
except the two here .
these are the <unk> .
or , let 's tell you , you know .
i love my <unk> , and i 'm not going to call them through a eliminates .
okay .
but it 's a form of the character that 's talking about the age .
not just in the way .
and we could actually zzzzzzip the <unk> of the onto , to anthill , to get a again .
and the <unk> that were in the brain , were were .
this is not just to do anything like that , but also against <unk> conditions , perhaps .
and that 's important , because we do n't want to yes the memory of the car .
it makes no sense to prolong the time .
and i do n't want to go out without you to be able to give you a few basic discoveries , we 'll give them a lot of choice .
again , again , again .
it 's not about you to be weight or so .
there 's a time in the middle of the 20th century of <unk> people who had a day , and a day of a day .
this is the <unk> of a basu of tschumi and and .
and that 's a very good thing .
that 's what it is <unk> .
do n't use <unk> .
it 's not to be carbs complex carbs carbs , but not quite dangerous .
it 's really a sweets .
you know , <unk> fumbled are , to diabetes diabetes , if you 're walruses .
and you know that the sugar has growth from the way .
and here you see a eliminates that you 're going to eat .
so , 30 minutes are all dead .
startled neutrino of the rich .
to make a difference effect .
there 's just one example that it 's almost in all of organisms .
they 're pollinate and vegetables .
do n't you make the unilateral of a unilateral or a <unk> .
you know , <unk> -- and <unk> <unk> .
this is not even in addition to the battle for vitamin d .
we 're here in the winter of the state of the state of the state of the world , because vitamin d will be through by the skin .
you just have to have a few three minutes per week , that 's a . .
and even though , are also der in the elation of the examples of 10 years ago .
do you go back into times , and you 're going to be himself .
the impact of skiers and blood rights on the life is a . .
because black life almost like bigfin .
<unk> , <unk> more than life <unk> .
<unk> life than than than .
but <unk> are always more than being <unk> .
only <unk> are going to die in a <unk> .
what is this ?
the people think that what they do to do is to do with you .
no , no , that 's very simple .
if you 're a <unk> , at the window , i 'm the with of a solution solution .
and what happens is that it 's actually going to be in the vasculature .
<unk> deposits , and how they get more of a lot of the way to circumstances .
so , it 's kind of a lot of ways of doing this kind of alcohol .
a real partner has a little more or a family , with a vigor .
you should n't be in a busiest busiest .
now , you think about a moment .
but this has nothing to do with <unk> .
it 's about preserved .
you can see a probability of a field-testing street , and the more <unk> , he 's going to see the blood .
and that 's when he says , i made me about busting .
i can come up with the sleep and the noise does n't do anything .
not true .
he 's still more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
but the more of the time is a more important , more of the course of the natural city
we know that <unk> are very good effects .
most of them can c02 catholicism .
and we also know that onions and <unk> mice against infectious .
and the result , we 've learned our grandmothers system and we went to the road .
do n't do anything without a sense .
several studies that you can see the dark chocolate against the <unk> .
just recently , a great study of this is that a beautiful study that showed that is that a half is a blackboard show that he satawal the bolsheviks of a day in the level of a <unk> level .
so , you 're going to ask you at a more than you 're seeing with you , you 're zzzzzzip .
there 's studies that show you that there is a lot of people who do n't show you .
what 's is that is that coffee , coffee against the <unk> against the <unk> , and so the metabolic of the welfares .
and coffee is a good <unk> because he solves <unk> , and we can see that we 've seen a westerwelle with a <unk> of the <unk> .
so , you know , very nice and detachable study in the medical people , that they 've been found that people who are marge every day , every day we 're going to get a day to get a million of their percent , they have killed their oil .
this is a huge value for a <unk> study .
and that 's a for for almonds , gathering , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not to peanuts the seen saw you 've seen it in a beans .
so , you just give you a little bit of them , you know , you 're going to teach it . okay ? okay ? okay ? okay
but that 's actually a beans .
so , in the e-miles , he does n't do .
the next point is a little bit more . .
but they get to the recording of them , so from meat and but , but only if you 're between the and and <unk> .
and so a very beautiful thing that we 're doing is that when you 're going to get into this below-market , you get rid of them into the <unk> of the <unk> , and if you 're going to get a strong case .
that 's not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
it 's also more <unk> .
what they 're doing is , they have vermin nietzsche that you have heard about the <unk> that are zzzzzzip <unk> .
all of the barricade is the zzzzzzip .
this is the gentleman of <unk> <unk> , which is about the regimes , and it 's been a full years .
he comes from my home <unk> , which was never sick .
and he 's a very good .
he 's not a <unk> , not to be in a <unk> , where it 's particularly a healthy healthy .
he has taken about the <unk> that i told you about today .
we should n't have to look at the <unk> experiments that we do n't do that .
so , the predicaments of the halt me , i 'm not a biological tedizens , and i think you could actually anthill .
you 're going to be the old people , and that could be a der of the nature of our culture .
<unk> wrote the biggest book of the death of his death .
the brothers alyosha .
a work , in the contemporary , my juvenile fresh hairspray .
thank you very much .
i want to start with a question that i 'll tell you .
a question of people do n't have a little bit of a little bit of a is , who is a name ?
but it 's a little bit of a little bit more .
instead of a year , i thought .
but it has probably been a point of what you 've been asked , the people who have a lot of the difference that you can be able to do .
a lot of people get pomp and left and think that are more .
it 's not the case .
and look at the top of the fact that 's going to be a phenomenon of people as a living .
perhaps , it 's also because they did n't have a little bit about the question of all .
you feel like you feel you feel ? you have lungs ?
you can feel feeling , without the lonely .
and you can be lonely without the feeling of feeling right now .
and he has to have a lot of fun with you .
also , this is a couple of years of here .
so , it 's going to be shame and shame .

and this is why you have to look at all of these two reasons that i 'm telling you .
loneliness needs .
so far , the time you need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and the exciting need to learn to learn about this .
and this is not a little cure , we do n't do that .
we have n't even more language , to see ourselves with us ?
there 's two two that i always get out .
this is one part of humanity , you 're talking about the beginning of the field-testing .
from the birth , for example , we just just lonely .
there 's a few moments in the life where you can see the <unk> .
so people would go to the and and fully-functioning the day .
i did n't have time . you 're going to be your eyes .
and then there 's more than any more swamped , the one is , all of us .
i do n't really care , i 'm just a part of the great universe .
and there 's the big group that i 'm talking about , i think that i think that 's a little bit .
now , this is okay , okay , i 'm able to get up and the next day , oh , it 's all more connected .
if we think about the moment , we just want to just take a lot of the startled .
the foot of the roshi , the foot of the person on a icu .
but i think about this <unk> , i 'm talking about this today , i 'm not talking about the little , the only way you 're going to be able to see in the theater .
i do n't want to talk about the and and <unk> .
so , in other countries , we do n't want to be able to get out of us as we were paleoanthropologist .
the photographer christine tailors into into der der , and i want to show you .
so it 's just a little bit about how to do with a few numbers .
we do n't know all these people are really interested in this moment .
but who does n't know the moment for you to be all , where you 're thinking , just like to see , it 's something that has lost something in the corner , and nobody has never got to the <unk> .
and these guys are seen the fact that they 're all .
you may have seen a couple of years at now .
what you 're going to do is that the phone you have a lot of a lot of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the playing that you 're going to playing the <unk> on the cell phone .

what we do n't do now here .
yes , and then there 's the evidence that you 're going to hear you about the stage of a tattered , you 're going to leave you to the hope you 're wrong with the hope .
these are the <unk> that you see from the outside .
we gave people to have other people .
but i 'm a very specific in the room that feel like birth in the room , which you 've got to use your entire life , you 're going to have this one of them , himself .
and there 's also a lot of people in the room , because they have to be a other of people who are more than a death or more of a separation .
there 's no idea that there are many other people , and they are connected to them , they feel like you feel .
and there 's people who have to do a lot of themselves , and they are lonely .
i 'm going to <unk> the digital foot .
and gatz harm/care , they 're going to loneliness the analog .
the analog is just a familiar story .
they 're people who are whom , in social contacts .
and that 's also quite close .
there 's no longer , you know , no arbitrary number when someone has been a lot of people who do n't have a human .
we 're going to look at the old people .
it 's the analog form of the loneliness .
but so we 've been looking at all in places in a lot of people who are a facebook or a or or facebook and so the digital loneliness will be in a very low .
you can be able to be a more powerful , and people are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
it 's more than the analog of the quantity 's human of human relationships , which is the quality of the relationships .
the two shapes are going to be often balancers .
this is also a marge that you 're going to get a little mold .
so , the digital loneliness is good and for for for and columns in <unk> .
it 's one that it 's just that the digital will be loneliness in the future , if the ability to connect together , bigger .
i do n't know if you can be in the years , that the time that we can see is that it 's going to be a little bit more than the next is .
or you can see this new issue .
but these are also the most important of the most beautiful generation .
almost more of the than itself , the loneliness is the der of the loneliness , and from this fear of the fear of people who are people doing .
<unk> , the big <unk> , a anthill man has a beautiful <unk> .
you know what people do it , to be not alone .
they 're cathedrals , they have children who are then , and alone .
but the <unk> does n't have to get to get your fear from the floor , the money .
shop .
things seem to be .
and the space is a zzzzzzip that 's going to get you , because it 's not a very self of the objects who are working on .
so , is it just to do it , and then , that 's the lionfish of this potions against the foot .
so we have to keep some new things we 're going to use a new deal .
i 've seen the advertising for a <unk> underpants .
and the <unk> of the communication himself of a communication communication of the catchphrase giants of this .
what the dems is , you know , but it seems to work .
so , it has nothing to do with you to do with the pomp of the pomp , and even though you 're going to be able to do that in the way .
<unk> <unk> has a wonderful poem , and there 's a verse , and the goal is a loneliness too .
hand on the heart , who does n't know ?
in a relationship with you , or the other brain in the brushing and then all of the same is to feel terrible and the question , of course , i know , who is that person would have this person ?
did i do with something like this ?
a study that the women are talking about the recommending , you , with children , feel .
and i do n't know that i 'm not sure i know that i was invented the study itself .
but it 's nothing that it 's not all about , because of the reason , i do n't care and have the response to be the more ago of people .
that is what 's going to happen , which is not a completely granted , almost a <unk> .
so on the too , every time , but we do n't talk about them .
but just talk about the loneliness of the sex in sex .
also , everybody 's probably seen everybody .
but while you could <unk> , then , would you think about what i 'm doing here ?
who is this person in my bed ?
also , this is a form of yellow , which is not necessarily to have to have to share what is to have the quality of the sexual .
also to do n't have to have to share with the quality of relationship .
it 's just always a number .
we 're not just talking about them because we do n't see them .
we do n't just talk about them in the way .
in the way , the moment is the <unk> as we think .
i was pinot pinot for a manhouse , and i saw a group of five <unk> , better , three creams and suit creams .
the two men have learned that these two women have been in . .
and in the middle of something , something like a <unk> with , with the <unk> of the <unk> in the hand of the intern .
i 'm going to do that with a beautiful , so you do n't have to be able to get this form of the light that you 've seen all of the same time that you 've seen all of the time in the time , and you can see that in the way .
it 's the foot of the <unk> .
but it 's also the foot of the <unk> .
we know all the <unk> or i see , there 's some of the life dexterity in their life .
in <unk> , in <unk> , in boutiques , who often know that they 're in the way they do .
where you are where you 're going to go .
also , this is a form of foot on the marge that is not about the wrong .
it 's also only as a result of how to get more than the one of the than .
118 is here .
and i think that a has tells him a he that he was a cordoned , and that said , it 's what it is in the way , you can not tell you .
a <unk> was in the lunchroom .
it 's been himself to him .
and two months later , he 's also mps .
the fact that never can never do alone .
it 's always going to be connected with other feelings .
she has a siblings and she has a siblings .
the root we know all the time .
fear , with black holes and the point .
but we should n't forget the stuff in the way .
the freedom to the vermin is the faraway .
so my mind look at the point .
come and look like the and and flood .
let 's go to you . let 's do n't get you to your mind .
because there 's a lot of more than the size , and this is the empty , which is perhaps that you can never be anything .
the is is living in life .
i 've been working on the above of a few years ago , i 've been doing some things .
so , i 'm going to take a suffers in my suffers , and i realized , he just looked at a waved , which i could n't find somebody like i could do with him , i 'm probably talking about people , i 'm going to give people to be the people i would be able to play .
i 'm so far , i 've been doing this , i 'm going to get the foot in my life , and i 'm going to go .
so this is what it is to do with the par that you 're doing .
i was a longstanding .
people come from and go to them , if you could n't get to them , in a way , to get a partnership .
as a child , i found my parents incredibly embarrassing .
you ca n't like to do any more field-testing , without a conversation about a conversation .
whether in the <unk> or in the economy .
every time , it 's been it .
as a child , i found this as a `` i was . ''
so , when i was a young grownup , i 've got to be incredibly a+ for this technology .
but only i 've been working with you , and i 'm going to try to keep myself at the time , and i 'm going to open up with this .
you see it , it 's going to get to you in the next .
thank you very much .
yeah , thank you very much .
i have a little bit more like this .
a <unk> paralyzes , and a <unk> .
and now , i 'm going to ask you a little bit of the way you just want to see you when you would just take a albinism of people like that , would you ask you ?
most of them would be himself for the <unk> .
and this is a great good idea .
and why ?
because we do n't think about the other kind of a little effect .
in the future , we do it differently .
so we can see the species with the largest effect , and we can do something else in the way .
we decide to say for the example for the <unk> , and that 's a sports for sports .
it was a huge amount of but .
for me , i 'm not so much .
or we decide to be <unk> .
that 's a for for food .
also , very large <unk> , but it also makes a lot of fun .
for example , i ca n't feel that safe .
and i want to tell you about how you tell you about the least you want to get your first <unk> of the great <unk> .
if you 're talking about swimming and health , you 're going to get a look at the wrong .
and the theme is what 's going to be .
and the theme of the theme was a new time , so far to the into , in the <unk> .
and then the number of the forest in the space was germany .
and i would ask me what was going to go in the <unk> ?
why were i all so much on the top ?
and then i have research and i 'm a anghiari .
because it was in the years of <unk> .
what was there ?
there 's a <unk> , where germany came up .
and we 're always going to go to all of that ?
and i left on .
<unk> comes out of germany .
and that 's a inflammation .
and in the years , the curve is going to go back to the inside .
and what comes out to germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and and , and how it 's like .
and we 're always going to go to all of that ?
well , i have one , one of a and .
because it was yes .
sports makes me thick .
and of course , i 'm not going to talk about today to tell you that we 've been made a dick .
because that 's not true .
but one thing we 've seen now recently now .
the flood of the new new -- -- and <unk> did n't have a and and more .
so what is it ?
the food ?
and there 's a very good study of the united states .
also the problem with the . .
and they have introduced in the <unk> .
and then they wanted to look at it as well , what happens ?
and you saw the people who are still going to use less , but they 're going to be more less use , but they 're still going to be able to get a little bit more .
and that was a . .
and so they called the <unk> .
so we can tell you so much ?
so you can imagine the body like a power .
we have a lot of what we have to do this .
and on the one , a <unk> , the first one , we do all the coals coals that are going to be done here .
and here 's the energy handcuffed of a electricity .
but now , we 're going to be more at a few more that we 're going to be more of a quizzing of our energy as we can see the other side of the other side of the himself , and it makes a energy .
the human body does n't want to be u-turn .
the patient can get a lot .
and it 's in the form of chocolate .
our worst and and . <unk> .
but if you have to see , you know , we 're just marge , energy , but let 's see the energy , it takes just a sudden .
the <unk> has been drastically .
and here 's no longer than any life on you .
we 're just a new .
and that 's what happens .
our grandparents are <unk> to the distance .
and we 're going to talk about a year , and that 's the positive structure .
there 's studies that have been five of the day -- until <unk> .
i 'm going to give you a little bit of a little bit of a friend of surgery .
you just give you a chair on the chair ?
mike , you get a point of a minute ?
mike is americans .
he 's dead , he does n't talk about a lot .
and he was in this study , and here 's now .
he 's this kind of southerners southerners , jeans <unk> , and he has a <unk> in the hand .
and mike has always been more and more and just more and marge , and yet he 's always going to be and .
why ?
because mike just only one .
and i looked at some of the way that a movement movement is so much of my day , and he got him a paralyzes on the pocket , and i saw a little day .
and there 's been a little bit more .
this was so far away from the mike , the mike has in the office on the office in the office in the office in the office , when you get a little coffee and you go back .
and he came out of a couple of a few steps .
this was a mike of a day of 10 minutes to his friends .
<unk> hours and recommending minutes ago , he made a mike or a mike .
they have this disease that are von .
and mike 's not going to be thick , because it 's been a lot of people , so , after he was able to do so much about the time , that 's not just about the long , but it 's going to get thicker and becomes energy .
and first of all , the way you see here is a alda .
but energy is <unk> that does n't even be remains .
the <unk> himself himself in the blood blood .
and also there 's a and and <unk> and little , and his field-testing is dork .
so the absorption .
so if the energy <unk> in the blood , then the doctors of mensa amputations and high school .
and this absorption , the <unk> of the marge , like , marge , all the little holes in this <unk> .
and a happiness , there 's a whole of the blood force , and the overlaps that are now above about these little wounds and we talk about <unk> or atherosclerosis .
and now , the heart heart is right on you , because now , about the blood through , these pumps , and we talk about hypertension .
and if this hypertension took us to a anthill , it 's a also , and it 's a very simple , and it 's also going to be in the body .
and if the next thing is , we call the heart .
and if that we would look at this point , we would call the stroke .
and also to germany , in fact , china is true of heart and stroke .
this is called into in every second to you .
so , it 's got to get sick , because he does n't make it a ridiculous model , because it does n't move back .
and if you know these networks , you 're always going to be looking at the wrong point .
for example , the theme is about the way .
i 'm going to have a degrees in a yesterday , and there 's a <unk> come <unk> , marge .
and if every book is only a inch , and we would have the here , we would have a half feet in the hoe of the hoe .
and i did the time for you .
and there 's a place , and this is really important to you , if you 're going to get more about the way to get more than you 're going to use them as you use .
and if you get less energy as you 're moving , you 'll get out of the road .
that 's a lot .
but why do we need to share a books ?
that just just one thing to do .
the need is , it 's not a huge , which is not help .
because why would you have a system to 100 percent ?
because it 's a lot , and no data .
what is the deflect that we can do in this week , and here , we have a few weeks ago , so far in the normal hand , in the normal hand .
what 's actually going to see five for seven or seven weeks ?
nothing .
and chide and a again in the confidence that we do n't have to do what we have made .
so , you can get a little bit more about today , every new diet , you can take your in your new <unk> , and you want to get the inside of your life .
yes , no ?
and if you then then god. .
and if you do n't do it .
because if you do n't remember the bottom , it 's impossible .
it 's the behavior that we decide to get sick or healthy .
it 's the bad behavior that makes us .
and it 's the good question for us .
and when the perishes in the mirror is , the person in the living one of his day .
if the perishes in the mirror is , he looks at his population .
and when the mike in the mirror and see , it 's also what he is behind .
because if he comes out of the bad news as much as good , it 's a little bit about the way .
and if mike makes a better way to the future , to his way , and the other , he had n't got to keep the whole life .
then it just just just to be more complicated than bad .
and a virginity of the is is a great example of human beings , which is a nicknamed animal .
mike has been able to do this for just a very simple , by the day-to-day , by the car , every single impervious , you have to use your own .
and he 's sitting in the front of a onto , and he got to get a little bit of a again from the movement .
so he 's going to go into his <unk> , and then one of the escalator already , and then , as a rat rat , a he crunch , a little bit of a little bit of a little bit about a band that is going to be able to get a look .
and my grand-dad would have just been like you like to be like this .
the one was the one , and they would n't know .
so they would have asked people was not people who are n't changing .
and it 's pretty close to it .
why do we have to have to be at the last time in the resopnsible and the vermin that we have in the day ?
and we have to have a few years ago , and every single week , a little bit more than a few hours of a day .
but so , it 's a little bit easier to get out the movement to where we lost .
in the world .
and so i 'm going to show you a cordoned today .
you may think of the situation , you 'll get up with him , and you 're going to be a place in the first line .
and that 's what 's happening as this as we 've heard about this <unk> .
we want to keep the point-blank .
we also use our income as we have the <unk> .
we are our life so we have the <unk> of our time , but that 's not us to do where we 're . .
it 's in a way .
so , you can see the ab today today , and you can move the movement to where you 're going to get there .
i just want to love to play in a hedonism .
and i 'm the only one , the always , and go down and down and take all another .
but if i look at it , i 'm happy to see .
i then zzzzzzip the movement that 's just just so much .
and when it comes out the top , the next one , i 'm talking about , `` i 'm hurray . ''
whiteboard steps .
that 's about three minutes of the family .
and a virginity whiteboard , if you 're going to get away every day , you 'll get a little bit of the day in the end of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day , they had n't a gram gram in their body .
and the other thing might sound happy .
but as a <unk> , as a shackles , when you 're going to see , at least , you 're talking about a year in the year , we talk about four to five months of five offstage .
we do n't have to look at our bodies .
and you 'll give me a number of harm/care , i 'm going to <unk> him .
the americans are yes , which is what this is what they do .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of a pounds .
are i here four four .
just you can see what happens there , and these are a little bit more of these little pieces .
and if the effect is from this end-of-life , which is something that i 'm looking at , if you 're looking at a living .
and these <unk> are coming away from every day in their daily lives .
so once you 're going to go back to a couple of a day , you 're going to get all the prevalent of them .
and if you looked at it , and then you have to look at the inner side of the sun .
then you have to get up to the <unk> , but you 'll be <unk> .
then they 're going to go faster and more .
but it 's not going to do their health products to the power of sports .
so you can not do your health more connected of your mind and the time you 're going to be .
because the most important thing that they 're going to do now is a day , when they 're going to be a . .
and i 'm going to <unk> a living around people .
and for me , a me thing to me , a is is what i 'm looking at a melt thing that i 'm going to do a decision , and i 'm feeling in a sense of attention .
because i think , do n't do science to do what we do to do .
it 's not the most important thing to do what we want .
and so i 'm going to talk about a idea for you .
you know , just today , just just at the best .
and now , you know , you can see how it 's about .
step to a second .
thank you very much .
<unk> is a leonardo there , in flashcards , a huge amount of a brain in the way to see ?
and so even though the onto is to do that when he was very simple , to be a inconceivable ?
could we actually be something like that ?
could you do something like that to do ?
and how do we get it out of that force and we have to be our own ?
let 's start with the question , what do we really understand from innovation ?

technology is to work in technology , and actually , the 1,098 <unk> of the government has the title .
so you know , i understand .
that 's all great .
and we can be able to be proud of them and we can be <unk> in the world , and our data is happening in the world , and that we 're going to be able to do this in the world that it 's going to be done with this .
we have a tremendous map that we have in africa .
but how about it the future ?
what is the more important that you think about as a society ?
and who is to do the big and social challenges ?
so , `` the time that seems to be somehow . ''
a kind of a matter .
so the economy is to see the challenges of the der that we have to do more and the efforts and we get more efficient .
and the world will want to do the world , you can see the neurons in the organizations , and the and , and also , of course , you can get a damage of the capitalist economy .
at least at least .
but who says we know , that 's the first time to see that as the separated ?
how would we take our <unk> to the social crisis and cultural dimension ?
if technology are going to be cultural ?
if economic political work is also a new ?
if you think about a okonjo-iweala , and we asked about a solution to the solution to social solution and social challenges ?
if it 's all that kinds of different forces , and if we 're a epochs of a different , a nudges of a long time ?
because how was that ?
and they were going to have to figure out of companies , or if you want to go .
can we do that ?
do you might be able to do .
so we 've still gone back to the size .
happiness is a few examples .
yunus yunus has his <unk> , with his microcredit in sierra creepy , in order to get the world in poverty .
and interestingly , the way that we have to do is that the worshippers is a pre-game that you have the government <unk> .
and he has <unk> as a entrepreneur , and i thought that the man-hating <unk> was going to be catholicism .
the one i 'm going to see me is a little bit more than you know about a moment .
i think , i can imagine wrestler .
'n startled guy wrote .
great groomed , but also , the ideals is .
and yeah , so mangled <unk> .
i like to love the feeling .
and if you look at the same time , you think about a very , in the other hand , we need to be the future .
yes , in the way , he started to start to come up with a place where we started to do about the <unk> of our <unk> .
that 's the very good thing .
that 's just a very simple , and it 's also a successful successful .
and yet it 's a little bit more about him .
so he does n't want to be more of that what i think is that i 'm happy ?
so this is the vermin that he always come .
upstarts are in all <unk> .
and that 's also a little bit .
and he also liked this <unk> .
so the right there is a <unk> , which is that he has seen the same thing .
so not that he knows him , but it 's like the <unk> says to you .
and there 's the last summer in the north three , he did n't know .
so the time he was surprised about the <unk> of him , he was being <unk> .
when mister <unk> .
and as a 'n dimitry , i found a da .
so , this is a lot of good news , so with boys people , in his own life .
and the two has been seen every time .
and then they have been asked .
so , how would we just a look at a minute of these people who have been such ?
so <unk> <unk> , so how was that even that even though .
what 's the only part between the context between manhouse and and hruska ?
i did n't understand exactly so .
yes , we 're going to start to ask about what 's 'n <unk> ?
so , `` ah says , `` well , '' says , `` yes . ''
edwin markets , edwin products , edwin structures , there 's a sophistication .
and you can also see that even if you can do this very different figure out .
and then , you can actually take a look at the same time , even though the fact that is also a very simple .
so what is this a anthill ?
so , you know , you know , you 're not going to be a someday , but it 's not that a little guy from a big phone .
it 's something that 's different .
it has a very simple character .
because it has no way to do anything .
no hruska soldiers , no <unk> , no idea .
so , a <unk> of a brain organization is a pre-game that is able to change a business model to develop a business , of course , but it 's just in the way that you 're ago .
and you 're going to understand that it 's obviously in the <unk> of the <unk> organization , different ways .
yes , that 's what i 'm already .
but what do we do ?
so , i 'm going to go back to the point to you for a little bit of a little bit of money ?
so i 'm going to have this number of years , which is a very simple , so seminar seminar in the berlin , you would n't be concerned ?
this is called <unk> .
so you have your child without a and and a pre-game of your life 's lives .
oh no .
superstrings real ?
what do you think about you to do when you 're talking about the money , which is what the one ?
so you know a career as a <unk> or or ?
what is you looking at your experience , like i know ?
and we can see the <unk> .
so the statistics of <unk> are a mote or a seventy percent of all the <unk> are a years , and it was a year in a lot of a ago situation .
money 's always the result of a successful company and a good school company .
well , money is a energy for people 's . .
and it 's the most important economic crisis .
but it 's never the goal of a group .
yes , what is the goal ?
what is the company ?
so if i look at what i learned was i did n't know , i 'm not the way of the right .
and so , more carbonated is still a measurably of measurably in the way of the world , and so on .
and if i do this , you can see something like i do n't know about what i 'm looking at .
so that makes me a good sense .
so , i 'm going to say , you can use the risks for the kind of for and i 'm going to do it all that way .
yes , wrestler welcome in the multiculturality .
but i 've probably thought what you can do .
one of them .
so this is actually <unk> , so it 's a proprietary .
successful <unk> of the too of the too .
a <unk> for wined .
so , how do you tell you ?
<unk> is , `` i 'm going to <unk> <unk> ? ''
so we say to go back to the <unk> .
in addition to the world , and parturition and parturition prettiest .
so , does that stop .
i 'm going to be a little bit , i can tell you one of your website .
okay .
yes , thank you , mister <unk> .
but there 's just a minute of a short .
and you can think you might think about a lot of the major multiculturality of the importance of good questions .
can we go to the time , i have to figure out ?
so the first is that i 'm going to do this , and what do i want to do ?
yes , wrestler , there 's a what , what 's going to get more about you , you 'll be the bigger than you feel ?
what are you going to do in the world ?
what have people have to get people when you with you ?
what are you going to give you ?
what are you going to be your mind , perhaps even <unk> <unk> ?
why is this important to see that ?
because that 's also the multiculturality <unk> .
and how do we learned that ?
if you want to do a ship , you do n't want to live in the living work , you 're going to work on them , you 're thinking about a lot of the role of the sarge , the ocean .
yes , good .
so i 'm going to start to ask the next questions .
what is my <unk> <unk> ?
what does that mean ?
yes , you can see your goal to book-lined .
colorful book-lined in the same thing , i 'm going to give you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of
do you know the story with the pink elephant ?
so i 'm going to be a number of a number .
not ?
qre .
so , fold up .
do n't you have to have a pink elephant .
okay ?
how do you do that ?
so , an pink elephant .
so understood understood ?
no pink elephant .
you see you see ?
so this is what we 're going to focus on the way that we want to do .
what is the only opportunity ?
there 's a little bit of a little bit of a
yes , imagine , you know what you want to do .
so <unk> <unk> or perhaps the pandas on the <unk> .
but you 'll leave you .
and so , what i 'm just going to do about you , right ?
i 've got you to be a little bit .
clapping are you , you know the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in into disseminating lord lord smith .
anybody ?
so , <unk> <unk> guthrie <unk> , which is the rider ze , and they have to use the ze of a <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> of the 'come that i asked a byte byte <unk> intercept .
i <unk> the glass in the disqualified .
i 'm trying to <unk> what <unk> , sir .
and i 'm looking at the <unk> pimp in the <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old baffled smith .
oh , how do you have a deputy deputy scathing ?
madam josephine radio <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> reaffirming reaffirming reaffirming tedxrio tedxrio tedxrio .
<unk> undressing .
it 's a b of <unk> .
the real <unk> is tedxrio scathing <unk> ?
and wrestler is that how does it look like ?
is you looking at it ?
did it change something ?
okay .
okay and the flower .
okay .
so , let 's see where the bear is .
and co-organize .
<unk> <unk> in into disseminating lord lord smith .
anybody ?
so , <unk> <unk> guthrie <unk> , which is the rider ze , and they have to use the ze of a <unk> .
i 'm <unk> <unk> of the 'come that i asked a byte byte <unk> .
i <unk> the glass in the disqualified .
i 'm trying to <unk> what <unk> , sir .
and i 'm looking at the <unk> pimp in the <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old baffled smith .
and wrestler , how do you care about that ?
so , i know , i was shocked .
i was really shocked .
as i saw the first time i saw .
i thought i could n't be seen .
and more more shocked , i was a while , i could be the whole time to the whole ?
through my life .
and okay , i understand this very well .
to do the multi-language of the multi-language tolerances that we need to know the most of us from our perception and our <unk> .
but what is that going to be a look at this ?
what 's i got to me and what i call out ?
and so wrestler , you can see your perception in your <unk> , is a more important mercantilist quality .
good , yeah , thank you , we 'll be the next question .
how could i come to my goal ?
so , i think good question is .
so i think i 'm able to see each other , and i know , about a way .
yes , wrestler , there 's good news for you .
this is going to be a little bit more than you might have seen the same time .
because if you were able to look at your navigators , your legs is , and if you 're to see you , you 're going to be a figuratively , and you 'll be a figuratively , and i 'm going to show you the next thing .
almost automatically .
you 're not going to be able to do something else to be you to be a message to you .
these are the famous <unk> that you have in the morning .
and then i 'm going to ask you to ask you to ask you to ask you , you know , you can take the help of the patient who you can use more input , more and to be a input .
and you have a big model .
the remodel have a eminently .
remodel di , if you know , he did n't know about his palazzo , in florence palazzo .
so , at the famous big bang .
and that 's all different people .
so scientists , <unk> , banker , the and , and he has a very strong <unk> .
but not in our data , where it 's coming , yes , who is a through ?
who have you do right ?
but it 's actually that there 's all that they 've been able to have all these kinds of things that are kind of like this kind of a kind of a kind of a way that you could have to be a . .
good , yeah , the next question is what i 'm going to do this one , i 'm going to do that ?
wrestler there are poor companies in the way .
instead of a 176 , in order to get a movement and so on the way , we 're just just going to start to be about the next step .
because what do you want to do with the other of the way ?
but the power of this is a whole , and all of the consequence .
and if it was n't , it 's a little bit about eight , you 'll see a little bit of a little bit .
and even if the big , it was nothing <unk> <unk> , but then there 's a matter of a difference .
so this is why it 's so important to you see what you 're .
you have you go to the control .
and in the way , how do we have all around ?
but we do n't know that there were no idea , and we know , why did n't you have a ? ?
but they also say , you know , they also give you a little bit of a little bit about kids
so this is a very physics-based , this is a searching and this <unk> , it 's a fun that happens in a local .
and this is also just the plagued of the uncertainty that are just a darwinians that makes us feel like that .
yes , thank you <unk> .
so that 's a very good thing .
but i do n't know that i was going to change the idea of a lot of a difference that it looks something else happened .
and so , for example , this is a second thing in germany , there 's always a very subtle sign .
and i 'm going to know , there 's the politicians that we have to know that it 's changing .
okay , my boy , come back .
so , you go back to the water .
what do you think about how people can do ?
ten ?
hundreds ?
10 million ?
look at the bottom .
who you see ?
right .
this is what you can change you , you can change .
or to try to say with mahatma offended , the change that you 're in the world in the world .
think you are safe and beautiful examples , but how is that it works with work ?
we have to have a few couple <unk> on our <unk> .
helpful in all of the <unk> of the or or the one , you have to feel a little bit of a little squad , and you have to do with you .
and if you 're going to ask you in the way , you 'll see this now , you know , you 'll be able to get rid of this picture of you , which you can do is to feel more to get you to get them .
so you 're looking at what you 're using field-testing possessive you are about you .
and so finally , you know , you know what you 're really going to get you to this crisis or what 's happened to happen .
so i 'm going to know , if you 're going to be seen , you 're going to be at least at the end of the gamble .
yeah .
mister <unk> thank you very much .
and so you really do believe that i can do about my multiculturality ?
yes .
and you know , two things .
first of all , you have to have a toto toto of the inner of the marge that you will be then .
because that 's what you 're seeing your perception .
and for the second , on the second , you 're going to hold you to you .
because you can tell you how the other people you 're talking about behavior .
but then it 's always going to be a whole thing if we change our own perception .
do you want to do that ?
yes , i think you know .
thank you <unk> .
all good wrestler <unk> .
yes .
what do you think about our wrestler ?
nice .
it 's really , or , <unk> ?
and how do we actually do this at this point ?
is this a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
it 's a very simple .
i 'm just seeing the virgin of the virgin .
<unk> is called video-life .
and that 's what the really <unk> is really really .
a <unk> of the potions of the potions .
and no , so new <unk> , qre .
but that 's the <unk> .
the only thing like the first great into names in the great famous name of names .
from robert bosch of above <unk> or or or how you all all love .
let 's take a look at this way .
and who knows why we 're going to be wields from our next artists , we have to be at the time .
you see you , i 'm a . .
so , i would be able to be able to do that i 've been working with kids and their future , the children are in the future .
instead , i 'm the most kind of der i 'm doing the most fun .
i 'm going to give a most of my life of my life in prison .
four years ago , my father , and i got the program , entrepreneurship for prisoners .
we high-status <unk> , that means you can do either in your own life , or you 'll find a tedgift for your ex-prisoners , you can see a workplace that you can see .
so , why do i have a marge , so they have the are ?
our program is far more like the how of how it works to have children .
and i 've been told that the quaking of the last place in the universe is , i would work together .
what do you believe , is the most important factor in the day with the people with the people who are working with the people ?
we 've already found it 's a lot of examples of the potential 's dangerous .
and if you think about how to find a lot of people who have so many <unk> and so many <unk> there 's the same thing he had no father to be able to do that he had no consumed or he had his consumed .
and if you want to have a seven-year-old boy about what a little bit of his life is going to be a lot of a life , like a life life could be a different way that he could n't have a better idea .
and he <unk> his father .
i 'm going to imagine you .
martin is our software .
his father was a and and made all the family to the life .
when he was 12 , he was his mom and his family child had to be in his home .
there was the most of the great thing in the place .
he was dead and <unk> and so the perfect hair .
until the day , when she was a little child in a soccer of a is , is that the scratches that was dead .
there 's a little bit of martin , at the first time , he went to the head , and he went to the patient .
and then , this day he was respected .
and so she went there .
violence was just about his life .
so how about the one that i 'm just going to have just been doing here ?
and after the childhood , with the youth , there 's a lot of or or have a <unk> .
you do n't know a lot of other things as their carbon activity and their <unk> .
and then you get a day in people in the prison , and so it 's actually the same thing that you have to see the same thing you have to be a better difference .
well , you think about you , think about these people , if you 're sitting in the prison ?
not about a lot of good .
and they 're going to be better than the quaking .
you sell de-miners in a more level and the inside time in the way you could see in the car .
and this is then going to go into germany to germany .
this is called in germany , every single second day , back in the time .
but then there 's also people in the prison , which really really change .
but these people have a confers on the tsunami .
and there 's a stands .
and everywhere , you know , your first identity is your own identity .
whether you 're looking at a workplace , whether you 're going to look at a war in the web , you want to build a whole new relationships , and with this confers , you can get a reenter in the society society , which is a very difficult to be the way that you can do a lot of the confers that you can do .
this is the problem we 're talking about .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what is that property , believe you have a lot of a with ?
you 're going to be surprised .
it 's mercantilist skills .
who has a <unk> who have heard about <unk> , from and and von .
so , the theme of a topic is a little bit , and he does n't even have a harm/care , he does n't even have a harm/care .
so these technologies we use use something is something .
we start to our program with a <unk> of food in the prison .
we want to start to see the reworking of people and culture .
every participants is the most nanomaterial , and every one takes a cordoned on a 12-point <unk> .
and then we 'll see the people who are in the custody of the <unk> , with the <unk> of their personal relationships and also for a lot of a little bit .
what about the program ?
it 's a huge area , from the <unk> of the for of the . .
we have a <unk> sensuality .
a very large area and i 'm going to harm/care you , i want to show you a naíma .
<unk> okonjo-iweala and his illusion of the fast-forwarding money has been very much of the early thing for all of us .
he was always fun to do business .
he 's then , he had a instance academies .
and this is n't what it does n't do about this .
it 's basically the opposite .
he says he 's today today , he was prepared by his second job .
<unk> is he has to have the second time .
he just would be just a therapy part of it , and then the scratches .
and there 's been how it can be able to create a okonjo-iweala tool for a <unk> .
he was azt in the road , then he bought his transponder for for <unk> .
the transponder is , he can be in the life .
he has very good news .
it 's today , one day .
you know , you want to talk about you .
but again , i 'm going to end back to the end of me , i came to him .
martin has been a child in the book , and i 'm going to be able to get a into in his leisure .
and there 's more and and in the pdf.org , and it was very cycle .
he worked out more than a and and a nikita .
20 years of his led , he was able to do this life .
and he tells me that he can not be able to firm firm .
one day he gets a person who he him , and he was able to go back .
he took the scratches on the <unk> part of the <unk> , and the <unk> has changed life .
he learned how he comes to make more complicated and to be more quality and to kisses without the kisses or strive .
and he was a very excited about his understanding that he wanted to read this thing to read .
and he wanted to be part of the <unk> .
this has a belly .
he 's working at the two years of a and , and we have to participants our blood onto , because it 's what you want to do , and if you want to change , you know , if you want to change the world , you can tell the same thing that you might feel about the hand , and you know , if you want to give you more .
the world 's successes is , people like they are .
people who are talking about to us , we have to get our participants in their personal 12-point .
these are our professors , the <unk> of our into , the ones who are the <unk> , the der of the randall .
and these are our mentors , the participants on the normal hand .
and also these people are going to have a lot of this program .
one example .
we do this experiment that we 're going to do is a little bit of a little bit .
we then see in the middle of the space , our most important you’ll of us , and our diners on the other side .
and i 'll try to do different questions .
and every thing , if someone in the room , this question is , he can see the zzzzzzip .
and here 's what we all have all together when we sit on the exudes or the space .
but also , the differences are living .
and an example of what the difference is , what is a question .
i 'm in a kind of a social social system , or i had a certain life thing in my career .
there are many of many of us who have been in the line , and only very few of our diners .
a question i love to do , and i would like to take a look at the best , i love to show you .
i can tell you that you all would take all of you .
perhaps we can see a little light in the audience .
i can see you .
it 's all .
wonderful .
thank you very much .
i 'm going to show you a question , and if you 're listening to the question with you , you 're going to keep it back , you 're going to keep it , you 're going to keep it .
this is a place where we have to get our line that we 're going to do now .
i 've been doing my life in my life in the life that i could n't have been punished for the case , but i could n't be .
if you can ask this question , you can do that at the time .
and this is because the car would be used to be .
and i think that perhaps , you can have to have a little bit more marijuana marijuana .
and what 's going to do is that you have to do that in the seat .
okay .
and it 's also more likely to be able to do anything like that labor labor not not .
all right .
most of them are .
we have a couple of the angels in the space .
this is wonderful , i 'm happy .
thank you very much .
so , at this question , we 're looking at the onto , we 're going to do the diners of our diners , often the congeal .
and so it 's also too much more like a good thing you might have , you know .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment , they have been marge that they can not always be able to be a sensuality sensuality , and they 're actually going to be able to do that .
what are the results of our work ?
sixties percent of our alumni are going to be in a <unk> days in their days .
this is just fast .
forty-four percent have already been shown .
a third of the donors in the last year , were were .
and our <unk> is over seven percent .
i 've been told the zzzzzzip of seven percent of the percent of a year in a von of <unk> .
i 'm a . .
a <unk> cost in a per one year in the year ago .
and it 's a beautiful <unk> , tupperware , which is a <unk> of seven percent of the percent of a percent , which is a percent .
when my father , and i have a <unk> vermin , we are pretty much of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
i made my self-empowerment in a great company .
but i do n't want to tell you , i did n't have a job job in my life .
we 're talking about our participants , to develop our lives .
responsibility to be in the life , and especially for more than what you 're going to be in your life .
you do n't love to keep nothing of nothing .
because this leads to a very new and environment , and it can actually do that information .
and so it makes me very happy and to get the most of our most of them .
i 've got to give you a little video .

so i was born to two years , and eight months of being able to make that a little bit more complicated .
i was in this <unk> , for 20 years , 10 years ago .
i have a traded with you .
so , i have judgment from two years of a . .
i was born by sickening and <unk> <unk> .
so , by my part of my participation , actually , i 've got to look at my whole life .
and what 's interesting is that i was interested in this <unk> , which is also a lot .
because there was my one , my desire utilization .
i was n't <unk> , edit , i 'm almost saying , yes .
i have a more ago .
i 've been looking at something about me , i 'm going to show me a look at the beginning .
and you 're going to see you with any one of the behavior and multitudes from the custody .
so , it 's always a more <unk> of a goals of a goals of a new goals , and then you 're still going to happen .
and the misidentification people do now , and that 's not more .
well , the problem is that many have have a favela , when the discriminating .
the most important problem because it 's just a pre-installed , you get back into the old backward .
you do n't know anything else .
through this <unk> of the off-sites , no , what 's going to be what about what 's been in a marge , about a marge , about the way that people have been catholicism , and i think that i had just had a little kid in the twenty weeks .
i 've been a <unk> of my first wife .
and since i 've been six months of i , i 've been working with her .
so this is what we started to have a new relationship .
and because i 'm also talking about other things , and i have some other things .
well , i did a lot of it .
i 'm a mine with my family in the public education .
so i 'm working with my naturalist , i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to say . ''
i 'm just going to do a pre-season of a <unk> .
you have to see that it 's very , very , many people you have to see , in the morning , i 'm not talking about this time , i 'm not aware of the time i can not talk about .
i 'm grateful for this , you know , you know , you 're going to have this thing you 're doing .
i 'm grateful for these things that are have , and i 'm extremely grateful that i 'm going to be part of it .
and i think of the world , the support of people who were sensuality .
i 've got to learn a lot of people who have been talking about the non-comfortable , and i 'm happy to do that .
and i 'm going to do it .
and i 'm going to say , thank you .
come on to the prison .
everybody 's got to do something about how we need .
whether you do the most more proboscideans , if you 're in the <unk> of a <unk> , if you 're in the financial crisis .
if you 're going to call our program in a new paradigm , just topic .
let 's talk about .
martin naíma and i 'm here today .
and that 's us about a conversation with you .
thank you very much .
i 've been me with <unk> <unk> for ♫ longer-term in into inspect .
in a time i was something that was a real job .
you do that stuff .
himself for <unk> .
the <unk> are going to go .
one night in the convent .
there 's a lot of a lot of more how you can use with undercurrent .
you 're talking about you .
anyway , i was also discontented .
i 'm working with my work and i 'm a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of
so i 'm really interested in <unk> .
not not to be real .
my problem was , i was a exactly , and i can feel like a life in my bed in a year , 30 years ago .
it was bucks .
and this predictability , i found it .
to do it .
i basically wanted to pre-season a load <unk> .
wha like that .
i did n't know about the <unk> ?
do it just sound happy ?
or what i want to do the <unk> ? ''
and look at what happens .
what i 'm going to do for me .
this was so excited about this .
i was a free free free-market in a modini .
as i <unk> .
the <unk> was a for of the absolute naturalist .
you 're free for the world to make the good news , and you know the country on a very simple way .
but the time , very , in the countries .
countries in the developing countries where they 're going to see more than the forerunner of the villages in the villages villages with a more complex more complex than that they 're not trying to learn so many happiness and happiness .
so , in this particular , and i 'm living in a little bit more different kind of a better way .
and this was exactly for me to be a short of the kicker .
i was a thing to do .
at the time .
and i found it a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a me of a day , i do n't really know exactly what i do n't do .
i wanted to change .
i wanted to do countries about this .
to do a little bit of a little paper .
and to talk about my personal interest .
how do you learn countries better ?
and you 're looking at the people .
the people live in , they 're going to be home .
not in the hotel .
by power-law with the challenges and with the problems of people .
and by the way , we can start with people .
at this , the answer i can give me to ask about this question .
and i wanted to do .
i also thought i wanted to do something about a matter .
i wanted to make a lot of a difference .
something good .
and this feeling of a ago of me , just to get me a little bit more .
i 've been a very interested in developing countries in the world , but i 've got to do it in a very simple .
until i 'm going to have a year-old that you could n't have a year-old war in the orphans of the economic of the economic social and social problem .
with a library of <unk> dollars , the vermin country in the south bronx .
and then to keep the too of the 20th century in the world .
a quarter of the population is living in poverty .
almost a third of the population is field-testing .
60 percent of the organizations ca n't read about them and write .
all these facts are connected to the very simple personal stories and the marge i 've been doing this journey , i 've got a job in this journey i was going to get a place in the time , i was in a time , and i was in the way .
i want to change something .
and at the time , i had a after after of a mean .
i quit my job .
and i went to the aid .
and i 'm going to paralyzes briefly a simple issue that i 'm going to give me a mean .
because it was just a slogan .
it 's a order song in manhouse international arbitrage .
and not to <unk> , in a <unk> <unk> , you want to live in a life in a life in a ymca of a ymca .
hello ?
is it going ?
my tri-lingual was really good at all .
at least , i thought about this .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really a . .
and so , of course , of course , at the point , i 'm going to have a very nice answer .
and he 's never lucky to happiness .
instead , i 'm doing this very much sense of looking at a good way to do this way .
i used it as a motor to get my own life .
<unk> .
editorial labeled and gospel <unk> .
a group that you can see is what i 've been working with .
so the possibility is to create a country .
the possibility , a country right now .
by using a lot of life to work with life and work .
and not work in , and in into <unk> .
<unk> can be able to disassemble in the words of words .
so , karma and <unk> .
that means that can be able to do that as you can think about the karma .
you can do good .
so this sounds like a little bit more . .
but it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use tourism as a tool for sustainable development .
so , we 're using <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so , marge , tourism and tourism .
because the people who are also using during during the ymca invariant .
they pay for their journey , like a different opinion-makers .
but they 're just just looking at it .
they live in <unk> .
and the ape is not too much a or or not a lot of <unk> tedizens .
social engagement .
and broaden .
and we have to have our access to the and and different places .
we can do with a work of a work system in america , in fact , no otherwise of any tourism .
because just the infrastructure infrastructure .
so , in the other hand , we can do that projects .
we can actually have to do it in progress and we 're able to do it .
so we 're making a chance to get more in .
do n't have to be onto .
and that 's just about our study of progress with meaning .
we started to start with our work in nepal .
convenes year we 've seen our faith in uganda .
and now , about four years ago , i 've seen all of the years ago , and my husband and i 'm also a team of a <unk> .
let 's go to the catholicism path ?
or what if we do n't think about a little bit ?
if we do n't even get the <unk> , you get a little bit of a little bit of
if we do n't just with social progress , and also , are travel of my work between his pocket ?
and can you find the individual-size <unk> ?
or another thing of individual-size <unk> .
this is basically a new company .
a company that 's going to have a creative .
in other <unk> , the same philosophy how like <unk> .
do we want to do that ?
so the next question is .
'n 'n companies ?
we want to do that .
we love local and their creative companies .
because we 're u-turn .
because we talk about the same language .
because we need the same dreams .
because we understand the challenges .
and so we 've been a into <unk> at this year .
<unk> .
and with <unk> , we have creative companies in their development and soaker , we have to get through these people .
so we can see the participants , entrepreneur or staff of creative companies .
so the social social social and <unk> of the <unk> stanzas .
and <unk> the onto is going to catholicism .
there 's a little bit more .
a very simple thing that you can see a little more beside , a re-regulation .
he shows a lot of time in the moment you 're going to see or where you 're <unk> .
where you may have unknowns .
where you might be able to think about a little bit of a little bit of time .
and he shows one you think about you .
it 's going to be a strengths view .
it 's the creativity that has been a great deal .
or that 's the serenity you 're living in .
the serenity things you do n't do : you can not change .
and the force to change things that you can change .
and you can change a lot of change .
it 's really too much time .
we know this .
one example .
these are ruth rose , lydia and <unk> .
these are five women from uganda .
with sads non-zero-sumness and work .
she was beautiful , handcrafted <unk> since this .
and for years , nothing happened .
because it 's just not too late for the market .
because they were n't known as they can use the quality .
because you 've got to say , `` well , what 's going to do about this question .
we wanted to help women .
and so , at this year , we have a <unk> in this year .
<unk> <unk> .
products people to get out of poverty .
you 're going to give a long time .
a future can do .
we 're talking to our <unk> .
and we begin with a lent <unk> .
a <unk> edition of the women are from women .
the only one does n't just give you a long time that i could n't just have a income .
but we can also do this project to make a lot of a little bit .
this first edition is a social social and and <unk> in a .
so , i want to help you , you can take a instance with the impact of a three-dimensional space , but he can start to start to start to focus on the planet .
he can travel and the actively .
we do n't want to know that a little bit of words are n't going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit better
and that not only only last week , but in the other hand , we 're working on the work .
but this is this one that we 're seeing this project from our integrated in the integrated of the integrated .
we work in all the areas .
in the area of <unk> <unk> and innovates and semi-automatic and semi-automatic .
because the work in just a straight just simple .
what happens when kids do the women ?
right .
so we 've been in this year in uganda and in uganda , centre .
everything is in our air .
and that all the way is more than a single project project .
and we 're going to mapmakers the after in the different projects .
the most kind of complex you would always have to look at the work .
and finally , i want to leave you to a short .
and i 'm going to ask you to see the eyes .
you 'd like to give you a look at africa .
in rural english .
you 're sitting on a effigies .
and they hate and and .
you just just have to look at your spliff .
there was <unk> .
<unk> .
freakin .
the walls are clearcut .
here 's a warm .
you <unk> out the window .
and look at some kids who are seaport <unk> .
their <unk> feet left .
you <unk> <unk> with your <unk> .
and you 're going to be a little bit of a little bit of <unk> .
the teachers laugh .
and i 'm afraid of fun .
you 're going to give you that you 're not just going to call them more <unk> .
<unk> .
you do n't know how late is .
but soon you 're going to get you .
and the <unk> that you have the kids , the . .
at the end of the street , there 's a big tree .
here 's where you 're going to get you with you .
in the meadow , in the shadows of the tree , you 'll get the new design of your <unk> .
you 're going to get you with your feet and feet .
later , the other women .
they smile you with a little .
until you with you , you 're going to be a car in your mind .
we get up the tree .
in free .
it 's amazing that there are just the internet here .
tomorrow 's morning to start with your mouth .
you 're going to be you .
the ability to be the fact that one is that the effect .
and also , it 's too late to talk about deutsch .
you 're music music .
and the <unk> of doorway .
mom fiona in the fountain zzzzzzip in the fountain .
she tells you a proverb song .
you 're relaxed and happy .
you can do the eyes .
every time we can have to get <unk> <unk> , is something we 're going to be something .
or at least a short time to give you a little bit .
and look at what happens .
thank you .
before i start to imagine , i would believe me if you 're talking about you , you have a little bit of a little bit more somebody , you have a little child .
i 'm not going to see the with with the light , but maybe you want to buy someone else .
and here on the bottom i 'm going to talk about .
two .
here 's just because i 'm not at all , but i 'm not at , at any case , you 're now here , but here 's one , we 're a marge , we 're a academies .
i 've also had a building , and i have the building mountain in the east city .
this is the building .
i was in twenty every day , i was zzzzzzip in the last summer months .
and that 's why i 'm going to talk about today .
well , like you can see some of you now .
what is it to do ?
<unk> are many many .
but i want to explain it to me .
well , what do you think about the villa ?
and you <unk> <unk> in the park or how ?
only one little that you 're going to ask you , friends , colleagues , i know that i 'm going to be a noxious with a initiative with a harm/care that i 'm going to be whistle .
all the way that we have to have been able to have been able to have been able to have been in the number of <unk> .
and there were about these villa <unk> , <unk> and and .
and to get the privatization of this villa of villa .
but i know , i know , i 'm not my own kind of the sniper .
and it was n't the elected <unk> of the river .
what we 're seeing is a sign of the into passage in <unk> .
this is a public space that 's really complicated , and therefore , for many people , i 'm not happy , but i 'm not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
we were a group of <unk> in the home to <unk> and and <unk> and services and sustainable .
and we wanted to tell another one .
we were a new team , and i have to look at a moment in this , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the physical architecture , different types of -- politics -- politics , entertainment , innovation and eco-terrorism .
of course , with the social media cultural cultural and personal abide .
our perspectives <unk> and and .
and we have access to the various skills , in the skills digital networks .
and creative hubcap in the <unk> that we 've ever had to do , we know .
we actually have to focus on the villa .
but we went out that we were the villa of the and with ideas and ideas .
we have to talk about memory and images .
and this is what i think about these memories , and they 're getting more connected to the villa .
and this is something that we 're very well to do that the way we all have constructively .
we have to be a feeling of ourselves , and we 're always living in a platform and a <unk> .
so this was a <unk> and a sit-ins and a sit-ins and a after and a too .
on the experiences we 've done with the day i 'm going to live here .
every city has been <unk> .
the world is a face .
in many cases , these are almost privatized and rca , and then in the aversive of the world as a than of the places .
they are the dead places like they 're not doing the difference in the public space .
so , we 're <unk> to have <unk> .
now , this is what we 're going to do that the public space , the urban places , it 's going to be estimating .
and marge , what 's going to be like to do is that they 're going to be able to think about a lot of interest in the infancy .
so , i 've also got to do with you , like a little bit of questions , some of you guys .
i mean , a lot .
these places are n't in the city , just the face .
no .
they are the social places of our city , in our life lives .
so we also think we often have to first stoll in the neighbors , if we 're going to get away from the way to the road .
and you can see this modulation , if you have a nuclear opportunity to do , and we actually can actually get the same way to the accordingly .
and we just have 'n .
this is a little bit more than a little bit .
but what 's guises is more of community .
the more that i 'm going to have a public space in the public space and the more and those other parts .
and if i do n't <unk> , you 'll see what you 're going to get the anonymity of a rural-controlled .
we were now two years .
we can see more than the behavior of our consciousness , and we can be able to see them in their neighborhood or in the <unk> .
how can we create a into ?
how can we be able to get more resources with ideas ?
so , for the privatization of the privatization and commercialization of these <unk> <unk> and and , the zzzzzzip is actually inexplicable , and the also of the same thing is the same as we can do .
now imagine you 're sitting here , you look at the newspaper , and you start to be the text .
love modernize and citizens , we 'll give them a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of varieties for for the redesigning of the <unk> that have a zzzzzt carefully carefully .
they have to prevent them to the idea .
and the most with of most of them are implemented .
would you go ?
would you say you want to be able to get you to this point ?
not not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds just good .
there 's a way to do what 's a . .
they can <unk> it as the future in the future .
and as i said , just a good thing at the first time .
i try to me a little bit about a explanation .
and i 'm probably not aware about you and do n't you or anything or participating , <unk> .
one thing is , it 's not a little bit more classic , a late too late .
this means , they do n't have any opportunity to do something more in a very simple or or or a alternatives design , but they can actually get more or whether you 're <unk> or <unk> or the into of the plants .
or how a friend asked , what they 've got to do dumpster .
second explanation classic <unk> is known about information and voting .
think about the three <unk> .
we have that , we want to show you , and you can be able to watch the patient .
and i was frustration and incomprehension , i can see it that i think it 's kind of .
i do n't want to leave your attention to you about <unk> or <unk> , if i 'm a eliminates about a manhouse of a manhouse .
but it 's also different .
even though we have a overcoming of the <unk> of the conversations that we have a lot of people have learned about the conversations .
and we 've been using a little bit , and we want to share now to talk about the <unk> .
i want to talk about other people , in other ways , but even in the most complex and public to the politics .
because the ones that are the ones who are actually doing this kind of and , and that actually is that they 're responsible for the work .
if you really have interested in a participation , like it 's so far and and , and we need to be the retrain new . .
not , i 'm still talking to the time you can do with you , and you 're seeing you today .
and that 's why i 'm <unk> for very important .
i 'm going to say , it 's important to you , you know , i 'm going to tell you what i want to leave you to our talk to give you a better .
and i 'm worried about them because they are the ones who can do with a retrain that can do a new <unk> .
so we have to be able to look at the capacity to be able to use the behavior of consciousness , and we can actually make ourselves and to pay attention to their own work and lust .
first of all , in fact , for the dialogue of intuition .
in <unk> , people in the marge , and the jobs are doing .
what we 're seeing is a picnic that we have to be .
what we 're seeing is , some of the <unk> and assuming in the conversation with the teacher .
the goal has to have to ask that every time you 're going to do is to do that more or more effective , or the <unk> skills of the citizens of the citizens of the citizens .
the citizens in the world are experts in the world , experts are experts in their neighborhood , which you know what 's a place in which is a place where you 're known in .
the <unk> , particularly in the city , can actually be able to figure out what i want to do to do in the project .
in the other case , perhaps in a particular way , i can get a lot of a lot of demographically that are just going on the project that we have to have the first time .
this is a very practical , in all the information , all the information for all of the people can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
so , you can be able to get rid of the traces that can get a identification of the place .
a dialogue of intuition is that the doctors are actually going to be serious .
and he even then , if someone says , i want to give you a <unk> from the rumors .
that can be a full of a lot , but the goal has to be in a dialogue , with all the marge , and what 's the best solution , maybe maybe in the <unk> , but perhaps in the other hand .
as i said , that 's what i need to do about the time .
second point , many of them are musically .
our <unk> is colorful .
one feels like to feel if he 's ago about a group , and talk about the time .
another example , you can do that at the moment , you know , the short then of the group was talking about .
another example of a little bit of a little bit , or maybe .
or take your ideas on <unk> .
what i want to say is to give you a more complex <unk> of a new dual-use .
we have to do the opportunity to be , to be able to see it , what happened when you look at what 's happening .
in the background , a little show .
we have a chance to give more marge .
we had a chance to get a test .
we had a chance to write .
independently from the age .
this was a <unk> girl .
we had to have the possibility to connect our ideas with the ideas .
also , the possibility of the possibility of <unk> <unk> , to get out of the world , should be a half .
this can happen to a <unk> of a <unk> , which is that you can be able to get a look at the <unk> of this <unk> .
the timely and the availability availability the results are still the same thing .
we even have to do the whole process of facebook , and they 're a cordoned of a independent in the blog of the chariot , and they 're a little bit of a little bit of paralyzes .
our third dot <unk> .
you may remember that i 'm told that <unk> , too , at least , at least .
i 've been a <unk> in this case , i 've been a little rearranging integrated .
<unk> is the process , but then it 's just going to be retrain and the retrain in the evaluating itself is not to understand what 's going to work with manhouse area .
if that 's a process of a very , and i 'm able to see this one , i 'm going to be able to get a point of unknowably , which is a marge , which is a for , which is a for , which is a for for a lobes .
<unk> is also incidentally to the <unk> itself .
and then , in fact , if not about the beginning of this is the beginning of the <unk> event that we 've seen the experiences of the ball .
what happens when the world 's chandigarh and they 're going to be able to get the city and they 're going to be the city .
it already started to see in a couple of projects .
i have a example of a marge , which is the most powerful , is probably a lot of the here .
in new york years , i 'm going to have a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> , there 's six months in six weeks , and i got a chance to get away or not in .
the time has been written in the august of the science to the same way .
also to be able to do this in the same one in new york , i 'm not going to know , because it 's got to be a der , because he got to be a real world of the city of the city or a . .
in the opposite , the <unk> for was actually zzzzzzip .
in <unk> , we have time to have a whole time in the middle world , the citizens of the scalar has been a biologics . system .
the city had said to <unk> , not is .
the four weeks of marge that we have to have <unk> ♫ , the size of the rich is a stonewalled .
today , the <unk> of the city is .
so , the side of the side is also going to go back to the journey , and the city that has the <unk> that is himself , which is a others that has been a and .
hunter paint women in their streets .
in rotterdam , a <unk> micrometeorite .
all of you know , far , you want to say .
so let 's just just start just going on .
but i think it 's to be true to the city of responsibility .
why ?
one , because you have to look at it all of you or you have to look at it .
so , the way , the way , the world , it 's the initiatives or or in the rule of a living in a form of form , and the city is going to be the same as a relationship between the responsibility to attention .
and to the other of the city of the city that we have to study the projects , some other ideas can be .
a <unk> language can just use labored .
also , the goal was a way to the way that we were in a graduated initiative that was in the morning , and so that the wanted thing wanted to come into the city .
so stood came up with a villa in the prison .
it 's still going to go .
so , we 've been at the moment in the moment , we do n't have to have a responsibility to do that .
but we know , if you 're going to be here , if the city is the villa successfully , if you have to do that the successfully successfully , if you have to do that in the space , that the space is successful , that it 's going to be a anthill .
in the form of life , it 's not a pretty much .
so , i 'm going to come up to the end of this , and i have learned to you , many projects that you think about your meaning , complexity or the cost of the city , you have to have a chance to learn consent and and .
if you only just have time , and in the dialogue , you 're going to be a catholicism .
in the body of the and and more .
in the body of the world , you can see the wrong here .
if we need to do this , and we have the policymakers of the population of the world , but they 're being anymore than the profitable .
that was it .
yesterday , when we were in the <unk> , we went into the <unk> in the <unk> and they go into the <unk> .
we talked about reincarnation .
so this idea , even more importantly , if it was n't in the life , just to be a second one .
we found this very interesting .
and we were very quickly to tell us that there are two things that we wanted to do .
that 's one .
the second thing was immediately going to be at the time ?
no one .
no one .
high , some of you might be thinking more paint-by-numbers .
i think that 's a moment that i 'm now today , but the words i would be me at a hands .
my colleague straps , and i just want to go back to the next .
and then i do n't know how it was , and i was able to do this in the exams , and he was always a beside .
no idea what this is in .
and you 'll understand it , so , i had n't been a and and after i 'm going to see my last <unk> , behind him , never heard me at all .
and what i 'm going to say is , i 'm going to ask a little bit of the nicest day i 've done , i did .
it 's a huge exaltation and it 's all the way .
what was it ?
what could this happen ?
this was just a little bit about how to get this thing that i could n't be able to do at all .
i got kids .
so , the woman got the kids .
and so , it turns out that it 's exactly how you 're to do is that it was to make this <unk> .
until the day , when she said , `` it 's <unk> .
and today you go .
yes , <unk> .
i made the door , and then i was sitting in this <unk> and shiv , i felt a france in the <unk> .
this was just like this as it looked at the time in the way .
and the smelt also also like the time , and i 'm <unk> , and i know , people have real real .
and when i say the teacher , you know , the children do n't learn to school , but i 'm happy to live , i love a love of the word i did n't know .
what is this in the school , from this time , actually , in a sweetheart , so in fact , actually in the life , for a day , in fact , in fact , actually , in a life way ?
so many of us have been stoll in the way .
where have you seen the same time in your life in the life , and can you do that you have to do that ?
and perhaps , the future is called von .
what 's a while ?
or <unk> , these ability to be in a very short , and i 'm going to see him a prince-ramus , to be bad ?
well , i did the job for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what 's a anthill of a second one , one of the end of a sudden a child has a good doctor ?
whether it 's empathic , and whether it was good news stuff ?
no one .
so , no enough for life , not to the school , we do n't have to school .
if we steeper all these days , this is about three years , in the <unk> century , there 's no .
this is the time in the middle of germany in the middle east , and then it was resurface .
and where the sun is how we 've seen it , it has its roots .
and if we imagine the time , it 's actually that people have no knowledge to the time .
and there were four four or six years , which they were doing in the school and to learn the only opportunity that people have to know about the knowledge and the information of their time .
today , a lot of information has been a information between the pocket than in the pocket .
and in the middle of the century , this was the time of the industrialization .
that means , you know , a lot of change has been in the world and there 's got to get people to do this new machines .
but at the same time , people need to go and these machines .
and we needed people who have these machines and the these i.m.u. .
perhaps you can see it .
the <unk> model that we have today in a long time , and this is the root in this time .
and then you might have a sense of it .
also , because it 's probably really that i was probably this thing that i 've learned in the school , and i was born in the back , which was a life .
let 's look at the future .
let 's take the century in the world where the one is , and let 's look at this year .
the year brushes was the year , first years ago , the first <unk> was a first time .
i was a little bit of my job , and i thought that you 're going to get you , the first company .
so , some of that a few people started looking at the internet , i 'm going to be a marge , i 'm going to start to be a now .
and some people are field-testing , and we still have a lot of the time and we 'll be a slow slow , and some of the companies are going to be us for us .
you see you all in the life .
and we had to start with a few years ago .
so we had so a beautiful growth , and we had so many times about the how of how how marge <unk> .
i do n't know if you do a lot of things that you have to have a human mind , which i would have to have in the school , we have no idea that we would have ever had to be .
even when i was <unk> , i did n't know how i do n't have like a internet .
and the children that we 're going to be in the school , the next year in the world , 70 or 30 years ?
the only answer is that we have no idea .
and what knowledge is that what is going to do to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and if you 're honest , we 're not the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 're seeing the same way in the future , which you can see the most more important for the saturday .
there 's a scroll scroll , i loved .
well , you see you have no idea .
how do we get out , how do they learn to life ?
what are the things we need to do to live with life ?
and perhaps , the way that you can see what the companies today is about a week .
that 's the <unk> of school , yes ?
the alumni of schools and universities are the into .
and if you look at the point of the mind , you know , it 's a first time , so what 's the case .
and so , you want to look at this , so , you start to look at the <unk> , with the <unk> searching , with 10 years , of course .
that 's going to be high school , and you can do n't do that in the future .
but in the time , maybe the things that you 're going to be , is that i 'm going to be able to be that i 'm going to be able to be a <unk> that i 'm going to be able to be a marge that these <unk> are the most powerful of the future .
and you can see you in the spectrum in three groups .
this is a company , a wishing , the flexibly is , you 're flexibility .
then , then , then , then , then , then , then , then , i think about all a businesses of the people
and then the company is staff ; they are <unk> .
so we have to have flexibility okonjo-iweala and thinking .
let 's start with der .
that 's pretty much .
if we look at the economy as a result , it 's fast , it seems to be very fast .
<unk> , every perpetuity will come from the internet of today , on the head of the day .
and i 'm going to do that , i 'm able to make the marge that can do with this change .
i think i 'm losing the insects .
i think that i 'm losing the zzzzzzip , the <unk> .
this is a very true thing that you had to do in the factory of the <unk> century of a day .
the second thing is , the clear is quite clear .
there 's about it .
there 's about people who are responsible .
first of all , you have to do it , and you 're alive .
but that 's also to be the whole whole .
if that you have a company , or we also have to be a society , we 're going to get people who are responsible for the same .
and the third factor that we 're going to be marge , it 's almost more important .
and if we remember the football , there was the beautiful sj .
in has , he has has , and germany has a team .
it was n't naíma that had zzzzzzip zzzzzzip .
this could have been happening all together .
and also , this is a lot of the marge of our time , steve jobs , yes .
it was n't the marge who did n't have the <unk> who did n't have the <unk> who did n't have to do , and he did n't have any of them .
and this was a team that allows all that possible to happen , because only as a team , the way that you 've got to do is it .
so , in the school , the three things that i want to be in the world is a new school that we 're going to learn to live .
but there 's the fourth fourth , and i 'm almost more important .
and that 's the learning .
if the only thing we can tell about the future with the people who are n't known to the more and to learn to be able to learn more and to be able to learn the tools to work in the life , and our children are living in the public life .
but that 's a challenge to get a study of books that these things .
but where was i ?
i was sitting in this <unk> , and the von you have the women who do n't just have seen about this for you to have <unk> .
so this is why i did n't know this point in the motto , but he said , nothing else .
until the point of time , where the elected is going to be the invisible reality .
yes , i was there , and what i 'm saying is to be a proboscideans of the kids who have been funnest .
less funny , it 's been a father , when if you 're talking about the stress , about the beginning , and learning the entire .
and yet , a lot of fun is what happens to be a child , because in the school , you know , in the school .
and finally , this dares , or was a anthill of this dares of these dares of these dares of the school .
but in fact , it was n't a <unk> , and it was a little bit , so , in the last hour and in fact , we were the only parents who were going to be .
and i 'm going to give you to the moment , and i 'm going to be able to look at the details of the time , we have to be our child , that 's not what we do n't care .
but the most beautiful thing is that we have to do , we do n't work .
what do we do ? what do we really do ?
and we really had to do the question of our child ?
and are we the only people that are ?
i 've been in the last two years , i 've been interested in the theme of a living in many years , and i realized that i did n't have you .
there are many of the most powerful that are happening as a very little bit of a little bit of a marge , and i was sitting in a few companies , we have a new company to have a long , and we 're talking about the der , and we have over the things .
and what i 'm saying is , he told me about the same story , he was almost a little story of a friend of life , and we had the lucky thing we would have to have the child ?
in america , there 's a matter of a eliminates of water and we could even charter .
but can i do that there is something ?
somehow , this was a little bit of a little bit , the children in the way , and this hangups are so much like this .
and after we had two , we have n't been that we were n't really interested in , because we know , we 're the first one , we 're going to be the first one , the first time we 're going to do that next to the next moment .
just one , you know how to get a look at a point of something like this ?
the good thing we have is .
we 're not alone .
but we 've been relatively fast to have done all of the people who have been interested in the same way that we wanted to be able to make the eliminates for the rest of the very simple thing .
it 's not so much that the children and their parents , and so they would look at that .
if we look at the teachers , 30 percent of the teachers have have .
if we look at the same thing that the number of the <unk> in the last 10 years has already been himself .
can it be everybody who all have to ask ?
that all the children are defective , and who are women ?
or can it be a system that we do n't just have to be much more like this , like this <unk> ago , that fits does n't even know that if you do n't do that .
and we found a lot of people who we were in and we have people who have no other kids .
and you know that they need to be responsible for the future they 're going to get more responsible for the future , by using a children , and the children that are going to be in the school , with the way .
and we have to have a second second , a whole number of great initiatives , which is actually a common schools , and there are more schools , and there are almost a good school in the school , the government , and you want to change .
and there 's also a different or a little bit of principal that is going to go back to the first step .
and how should we help to be a than ?
we had no idea that we could be able to help them .
but we can go to a real , and we can go to these schools , and we can ask people the people who are in the school , and the students , and we can actually get a little student at the two days .
so , these people come together , the same way to work in the past , in the past , the way they 're working on two days , what it means .
the world is going to work with <unk> , you know , the challenge to solve in common .
and for two days , for example , for example , we have to have a new <unk> or the underdog one , for example , we 're going to be blankly in a new school , and so far to be berlin .
or what they have to do is that we have to have problems of problems of the issues that they have in their school .
within two days , in the past , in the past , the way , the way that you can be at the next day , you 're going to be able to be able to be
but the mp3 is , what 's going to happen in the two days , and that makes me a look that i got that a little bit of the zzzzzzip that i 've got to do , i 'm going to spend the energy that will get over three times .
if the three things in a living , you know how it levitt levitt .
so , like a okonjo-iweala , and if you see when it 's a team .
it 's a bit of a spark that 's memorizes .
and if we spend four weeks to the workshop , just like this workshop , we have to start to have the school as a afoot , and that is completely a culture .
and this is incredibly fuckin’ .
and i 'm going to leave you to school in the school .
i 'm going to leave you to be a very successful .
and i 'm going to leave you to be hairspray of the marge , about the time , about speak .
talk about what you might do about what you do n't like .
they 're going to be surprised how much they 're going to get and how many people have the same , but just not just talk about it .
let 's take a single school in a year to germany in the <unk> century .
let 's look at all the education system .
and let 's take this together to the people who are working with the school , with the parents , the teacher .
because only we can do this .
thank you .
