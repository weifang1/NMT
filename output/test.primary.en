as a steve lopez , bittman der , when you were invited by the streets of the angeles , he said a great music .
she came from a man , a african-american , likable , roughhouse , who was only in a violin , who had only been a nodel .
many of you will know the story , because of course , from <unk> article , it was a book that was torturing , with robert downey junior , and <unk> promising , who <unk> scratches , and <unk> promising through through through through through through through and through promising through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through through .
nathaniel amritsar , when a <unk> and a half years ago , he was going to die in the streets of <unk> in the center of a month .
i 'm going to read you to be <unk> , or to understand the movie you can do about the whole life , and also , the music that was able to get the instrument , which is the physics-based , which is the physics-based , that <unk> , from the physics-based , which is the nathaniel , that <unk> .
i met mr <unk> in the years of the year in the years , and disney , in der walt .
he just had a demo of snippet first and and , and came back to the stage to try .
he talked about a very <unk> and laughter tone about kyu and hillary , and how the dodgers would never be able to get into the baseball world , and the world of the <unk> violin of the first show in the last stage of a betray show .
we went to talk about a topic in a bit , and a few days later , i said that a himself that i was interested in violin .
i have to say that a pre-season treatment , because he was already with and with and marge and marge treated , a trauma , that trauma is a atrophy .
so as a result , he 's now to do this for a schizophrenic , and i 'm so bad , and he 's going to be in the streets of <unk> cannery , and then <unk> and horror <unk> .
and in this way , in a <unk> , we were talking about the nationalgeographic.com/genographic of the first disney in the walt disney , and he had this nutty flickering in his eyes , and he lost his life in his eyes .
he talked about the demons of the demons and see how it wanted to look at the relaxant .
i had fear of no , i was afraid that i could lose it in the god , and i can just get him to be able to talk about the violin , and i 'm going to talk about the and , and i 'm going to talk about the and .
so i started just to play .
i was the first sentence of snippet <unk> .
and while i played , i was looking at a way to see that in a eyes of a eyes , a planetarium change .
it was a person who is in a invisible starlit , a chemical response , my catalyst was my game .
<unk> <unk> is what 's happening in the way that you can see and into .
and as a miracle , he took his violin , and i started to kill a few of a clips of a some of a and of a video and and , and i asked to play her . she marge me to play .
so we started to talk about music to start to get more bach , <unk> , <unk> and moviemaking to the other .
and i realized that he just not only a anthill of the music , but it 's also a very simple simple relationship .
he talked about a passion and a understanding that i just just do about my colleagues in the philharmonic of los angeles .
by the music , he was talking about the night , was a infographics , pacifists man who had been through by the streets of a angeles , a marge , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in into .
music is medicine . music is changing .
for example , music midline music .
because the music can allow him to him , his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in the same thing .
and so he <unk> his agonized .
i understood that this is true to art .
this is why the answer is , why are we going to do , `` we can do is that we 're in the open , our feelings , through our creativity to see .
and the reality is , we can all take us , and they 're moving , and we 're going to get us .
what nathaniel wearisome , so he took him a music of a music of friends .
the <unk> force of music , it went back to a family of musicians that could be his career and his qualitative .
and i 'm going to go back with a musicmaking , whether you 're <unk> in der walt or or , because he 's me , i can musicians .
thank you very much .
bruno giussani : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i 've been <unk> <unk> .
i hope you 're going to do .
so i have a lot of new york .
i just just heard two .
this first one that was a kind of a fling .
it was a wonderful fish , <unk> , good unctuous , <unk> best-selling .
what a video .
well , it 's been better , he was going to be in <unk> in the after of the highest .
so you could be able to touch him .
i was a kid with this wonderful day .
one day , `` the first time , '' i asked her as a result of a conference , and so i was able to be able to have a conference in the sustainability of the nest .
`` of course , '' i said .
this was a company that has to solve what this is a marimba problem for our iphone . how do we get fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years , we have the ocean radius as we were forests .
it 's hard to overstate .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the commandeer , the commandeer , swordfish , they are collapsed .
it 's not more easy to be left .
so , `` i 'm going to do , or bad , marge , the one of our future .
a lot of people , . <unk> the environment , most of them , we 're tuna . we have a . .
he has a <unk> of 15 years .
this is why to use 15 pounds of lest , you can get a little <unk> .
not very serious .
ca n't very well .
so here 's a company to do , and it was trying to do it .
i wanted to ptolemy them .
and on the tsunami , i did the catholicism of the eco-terrorism of the company .
we call him .
`` don , '' i said , `` only to know the facts , you 're famous for you to go to the sea , you know that the environment is not able to be able to understand the environment .
`` this is true '' that he is , `` we are so far outside that the power of our fish will not be '' .
and then he got to do , `` we 're a dente world .
this <unk> of <unk> , he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> , one thing .
`` `` , one ? what do you do ? ''
`` biological proteins '' -- he said .
`` great '' , i said . ''
and at this evening , i was in the evening , and thought , what the hell is a political molecule ?
so i called the next day , the der , and so far .
i said , `` don , what 's the proteins are sustainable ? ''
he said he did n't do it . he will be responds .
now , i 'm talking to a couple of people in the company , no one gave me a boatload answer . until i finally , i can finally with with the succession of the biologists .
we even hear it .
`` don , '' i said , `` what is the sustainable are sustainable proteins ? ''
well , he mentioned a couple of a and and some <unk> , and he said , `` . . ''
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , dry , skin , remnants and too . ''
i said , `` how many more rub is no ? ''
in the case of the perhaps of the perhaps of the von of the perhaps .
`` well , this is about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , `` well , what is really serious to get a field-testing , to get the fish ? ''
there was a long day in the dark , and he said , `` there 's just a lot of a onto chicken in the world . ''
i 'm me me from this fish .
no , not because i 'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that 's actually one .
no , i actually have a actually <unk> of this country , because i 'm going to be a marge of god who is in the garden for twitter .
this second fish , this is a different kind of year-old .
it 's the happy , the way you can do , you 're going to get your fish , you get the fish out of the fish .
i 've got him about a into in a restaurant in <unk> .
a swinging gynecologist had been a long time to have been a long time at this school .
she has a denigrated of a denigrated .
he came out in the table , almost bathed white color .
the chef was him .
you twice .
it was still delicious .
who can make a fish like this , well , after he was <unk> .
i ca n't . but this guy can do it .
we we them . actually , he 's got it .
and no , he has n't got the fish do , and he 's not a motor . at the way , you know , i think i understand .
he 's a famous proboscideans in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner .
it 's close to the <unk> of the river of the river .
until the mid-1980s , the air in the hands of the . .
they were <unk> <unk> in what they were in .
they made that , they would take the land .
they built this complicated aversive of enlargening , and they get water from the country , and then the sun in the river .
well , they could n't make that the time , not economically .
and ecologically was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of birds in the place , and there are no birds in the place .
and so , there 's a spanish company called the country for the land .
what did you do ?
they have the water of the water in the water of the water .
they literally literally catholicism .
instead of the water <unk> , they used to get the channels , they can go through the water .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 hectares -- <unk> , <unk> , eel -- and -- company and and company .
the air is incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen this one .
they 're non-obvious on the context of the beach , and everything you see is channels and and , and we have to march .
i was n't a long time with miguel .
he 's a hotshot guy , three parts of the charles , and a part of `` croc '' .
okay ? so we were able to get through the wetlands and i 'm and and <unk> , rambled , to whiskey rambled rambled to my pre-season , and miguel holding into into .
this is what a friend he gets a common <unk> .
now , he mentioned the <unk> of the . .
and here 's the one of the patterns of the marge that he was talking about the tanzanian .
it turns out that miguel has the biggest part of his career in africa in the kruger .
i asked him how he was to be a cordoned .
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know about fish .
i 'm a pundit for relationships . ''
and then it 's then , and it 's going to be more into in a three-dimensional range of a three-dimensional and and and strange <unk> .
and i 'm not sure that i 'm not wrong , which was really amazing , you know , the erwin community , like this .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head became a above of a <unk> piece of marge that i 've seen on the brink .
so i made it out . i said , `` miguel get your body like this ? ''
he showed up the 1960s .
`` i know , i think the algae , the connection , that 's incredible .
but what are your life ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
well , he 'll tell me that it 's a aspirate system that is a aspirate system that the food is in the animal .
the vegetable foundation , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish went .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there 's no food .
the one of the foot are n't the animal , their their ?
later , i went back to this stage , and i asked him , `` i 'm going to be a place to be , '' and as a while i 'd like that when i 'd better do ? ''
in this moment , it was a whether as a hoffman hoffman had a <unk> .
and we started to look at the corner and we went to the hospitality light , thousands of millions of marge , and they 're literally pinker carpet , and you can see the eye .
`` this is a '' , '' he said .
`` look at your bellies , marge .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` miguel , do n't you your attention ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we are born 20 percent of our fish and <unk> in the birds .
now , last year , in africa , 600,000 , more than six different types of ways .
it 's today 's largest today , and one of the most successful in into europe in europe .
i said , `` miguel , is n't a good job , you know you want to have a onto ?
he ministered his head , no .
he said , `` we 're building <unk> , not extensively .
this is a high-sugar-content network .
the flamingos are killed the waves .
the shrimp are the catholicism .
so the pinker pinker der is the work . ''
okay , let 's start thinking a pre-season . you have a toilet , your farm , not your body and a cow who do their success of the people .
a <unk> , but also a anthill .
oh , and the way of the flamingos should be flamingos of a ubiquity .
they 're going to be a noxious of a year , where the evaporated are better for the toothpicks .
every morning can go down to the beach .
and every night , you can go faster .
they do that because they get the <unk> white der of the highway .
seriously .
i had a kind of day of the penguins , so i looked up .
i said , `` miguel , how do you get to get away the kilometer miles in the air ? ''
do you do that for the kids ? ''
he looked at me as i was a song from whitney .
he said , `` no . you do that because you 're going to be the food better . ''
i do n't have the skin of my beloved , the delicious , and i do n't like to <unk> it . i do n't know you . i do n't know you . i do n't know you .
it 's this scathing , <unk> .
i never know about that .
and yet , when i do it in this restaurant in a restaurant , you have n't been able to get a slay after .
she felt happy and she 's going to be a bites from the ocean .
i mentioned this to miguel and he naps .
he said , `` the skin is like a little .
she 's the last caginess , before something that you 're living in the body .
it has evolved to evolution in the way that 's <unk> suck . ''
and then he got a : : `` but our water has no dicking . ''
okay . a farm who do n't live on the fish , a farm who is their role in their success of their hyenas .
and then i was a marge , and he dicking a marge , because the water that i get through this city , and i get out into this town .
it 's a river that 's all that things that you can see , of the rivers of the nowadays of the world today , to pollutants chemical , the von of <unk> .
and if it 's been a through , this is a water that 's going to be like this .
the system is so healthy , it 's the water .
so , not just a water that does n't have your animals , not just a farm , the one of your life in the health of your hyenas , but not only to the fish , but i 'm not going to be able to get you for the fish .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i 'm going to do , and you should n't do , because this is a little bit , because this is a revelatory , which is also revelatory .
you might say that you 're going to be a simple issue for the future of the way we 're going to be von or <unk> or <unk> .
we need to be a brilliant new concept of agriculture , from one food in the food .
but for many people , this is a little bit of radical .
we 're not a marge , we <unk> . we are lover .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we talk about the food food . we eat in nature .
and if you think about that things that are the same of the future of the food , it would be a and , and says , `` hey , i love the flamingos , but how do you get the world ?
how do you get the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i do n't like this question .
no , not because we get enough calories to get the world to be more than you need .
a billion people will happen today .
a billion -- this is more than one day , but <unk> , in the distribution , not the der .
well , i do n't like this question , because they 're zzzzzzip the <unk> of the <unk> 50 years .
slough grain in the marge , <unk> , in the earth , there 's no agribusiness , and the whole time he asked the first , `` if we can get more people as a can of a marge ? ''
this was the motivation . it was the clinician . it was the 1.0 of american agriculture .
we should call them to do what a is in <unk> , a market , the short , which is to actually exactly the marge that can do this production .
this is not a television , and it 's not agriculture .
our <unk> is today , not at least <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not to the newest and and , but through anther water , not by chainsaws and nets , but through the world in the ocean .
you want to get the world oil ?
let 's start with the question , how do we get to control ourselves ?
or better , how can we create the conditions to control a community ?
to do that , you do n't look at the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's a lot .
and the and , and machines are <unk> , and it never never had a good good question for food .
let 's see the ecological model .
this is that in the two billion years , . .
look at a poor , farmers have miguel .
sweatshops , the most dangerous are , in fact , the restore instead of movement , farmers are n't just marge , but the for that are n't experts .
because you 're the ones that are experts in .
and if i 'm really honest today , you 'll be a better issue than i 'm going to be .
you know , this is me , because when the future is the future of the food , it 's going to be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to talk about today , this is the zzzzzzip of the data that we 're seeing , bigger is the same as you can see when you get to the <unk> , and instead of the <unk> , you know how to get information about how we can do to see that we can not see that these kinds of systems that we could n't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
so what we 're seeing here is a demise <unk> for age .
the program i 'm doing here is a little experiment .
it 's called and and what i can do with <unk> is that i can do to be a noxious of the more , `` we can get out of .
and then i see a different pattern that makes sense .
and that 's because of the <unk> , people are in the thailand of the world , and they 're sitting on the <unk> .
we can go to a step further and we 're going to start the data , and look at that one that is that suspects , and not the sound of a marge , but not for everybody .
if we 're going to go back to the age , and we 're talking about three years or the see , we 're seeing the under-five of the under-five of the people who are going to get people to get people .
and the sees is that this is that particularly interesting is the most important .
so you know that this is a information about information and data in this way , and it 's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a nasdaq .
and if we can do this in nature , why can we do that content with you ?
what we have is that the are is a single everybody every single day that have ever been .
it 's all . here 's all over online .
you can just show you about my talk to your waldorf-astoria .
with <unk> , you can see a huge in a decade .
you can see a difference in a different year .
you can jump directly to a particular banjo .
if i look at this , i see the sounds of the into , and i 'm going to get a skating .
i 'm a lance of a fan , so i 'm going to show you the expenses in the lance .
now , if i 'd just like to get a <unk> paralyzes , i think , `` well , how do i do with all of me ?
so i 'm going to go back and take the point .
now i see greg greg .
and so you get a idea of them that if you 're going to get around your kind of a way to get a information on the way , and if you 're going to take a little bit about this kind of handlebar , handlebar , handlebar , <unk> , you do n't just feel it or not easy .
you do something that you 're looking at something a little bit .
it 's something between us , and we think it 's changing the way that information can be used to be able to use .
i want to do this idea of a little bit more about a little bit of a little bit .
what we have is that we have a single <unk> <unk> , and they 're going to reduced .
the cliffsnotes one pre-season a pre-season and a symbol of the curve you get .
i 'll just just take the number 500 500 of the amusement .
but even in this unconstrained , we can do a lot of things .
so we immediately get a look at the issues of the issues that you 're in the wikipedia .
i 'm going to give you the issue of the . .
now , i 'm elected , i know , the most of them are at least warner , people are the people who are in the year .
this is really important , because this is a definition that is not in a single <unk> .
this is just one that you 're going to see a step back and all the time .
outwardly on a certain of this <unk> , i can warner the patient in the more humans , people are going to go back to the next day , and everybody 's seeing together .
if i look at all of these people as i know , the majority of these people are are . some of them , i 'm going to be a boss . here 's a message from a planet .
and interestingly , a is x-files is a ted x-files .
so we can see a and and a look at all the x-files of the ted .
you see , we 're seeing this in the web , if you 're really going to be a web , not only one side , but a lot of it is .
and so i want to tell you what i 'm going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a little surprise .
i 'm going to just just give you a new york times a new york times .
<unk> , i do n't want to call a browser ; it 's not a browser , but you can look at a -- -- and we can look at the <unk> , and we 'll take these <unk> to each individual website like this .
so i can go back to a step back and leave a straight line .
this is why you 're important to be able to look at this very simple , but you look at the beginning of what 's going on in the way , and the rest of the digital system can look at the same way .
so i can see my life in a certain below-market .
here 's the whole demonstration that i 've been doing with this .
and i can just ask something that i 've seen before , i 'm going to look at the time .
and if i take a step back to you , and i can see my living in a little bit more after in my <unk> , here i have a marge , and i 'm going to live in bing .
and from this , i can go to the side , and you can see them .
it 's a metaphor that allows just a again , and every time it makes it a massive form as the sum of the distributed .
in the world , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we talk about the curse of the <unk> .
we talk about `` drowning '' in information .
what if we could have this situation , and the internet on the head of the way , we 're still going to be able to do that one of the other things to do , and we can see the same thing that looks like a otherwise ?
if we can do this , then , the growths <unk> , maybe a new source of information information .
and it 's just easy to move into information , and we can know how we get .
and if we know about how we know about how we could see holt .
so i 'm going to hear me , thank you very much .
i grew up with a corp in science in science 's scientific .
in my office , i went to the bus to a day , a day one day .
and my legs also want to be a book in a book , a <unk> , the way to me , in the worlds , and i 'm just trying to get a deep wise , and curiosity curiosity .
this seems to be a little bit of a little bit that i always felt in the school , in the forests of 2001-2002 and frogs and beetles and beetles and everything .
i was totally <unk> , i know .
it was always trying to understand the world and the limits of the biospheres .
and my love to science was taught me in science in the environment , because we went to the moon .
jacques cousteau in our own system , and the urbina idea that we face animals , and places in the world , and we 've got to know ourselves .
this is what i think about the <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could draw .
and there 's no video to the video of a <unk> with that der , and i had to create the pictures in my head .
we had to all have this thing . if we met a week , we took the description of the author , and we 're going to stop the screen .
my response was a was and and of the marge , and living , and all of the way .
in the x-files , i was going to wham around the teacher , i felt the textbook textbook , <unk> .
the creativity had to do is .
and this was something interesting about me , something that i was looking at jacques field-testing schneider , the idea was a stonewalled of the world in the earth .
i 'm never going to get a living in the world , with a spaceship , that seemed never been a very unlikely .
but this was a world that i was in the earth , and she was so fascinating for exotic , which i felt like i had to learn this day .
so i decided to be , as i was 15 years old .
the only thing i was in a little village in canada , a distance over the next ocean .
but i did n't even get a lot .
i 'm going to take my father , until he finally started to <unk> a <unk> in shittiest , new york , the sun in the other side of the ocean where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of the <unk> in the winter of the world in new york .
but the ocean , a global ocean , i got to be two years later , when we went to california .
since the 40 years that i 'm now acknowledgment , i have about six hours of water in a million dollars . 500 hours of them in <unk> .
and i learned that the world is the deep ocean , so rich are <unk> in a way that we can do .
the most fundamental nature of nature is not to be able to be able to be able to see our own , in our own , the most important .
until i 've been talking about this time , i 've seen the for that i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean , with the same intensity , like the and and the . .
when i 'd like to have a than , a was , was it to be the moschen .
this seemed to be the best opportunity to tell my body to do , with a need to create images .
as a child , i would like to see comic and so i think .
so , the der of these were the images , stories and the accessibility . they were together .
of course , the stories i love me to be : , `` ma , '' `` aliens , '' `` `` , '' `` `` . '' `` `` . ''
and i 'm called `` `` '' i can mean my preference for the ambient and vermin .
so i 'm talking about my two .
something interesting happened to `` , to ask a butler issue in this film -- and we had to create a kind of an liquid on a animation , <unk> , back .
what happened to the first , i was in the movie .
the film was a money , but he was asked to him , and i thought about something amazing , and i saw something that i saw the audience in the world , like the magic that osage from the magic .
and arthur arthur clarke , but are is not <unk> and and .
so you saw something that looks like .
and this is what i found that an amazing thing .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's got ta necessarily be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
so we went to `` six '' or my next film , more complicated .
together , we have to do the guys of liquid in the metal room , which was a effect that it makes us that that makes us that that makes .
and it worked . again , we had a whole thing in the audience , but the idea is the same thing , but we 've been able to get a little more money .
and those of these two experiences was a whole new world , a very new world of creativity .
so i started a company , with a good friend of marge , winston , the <unk> of the best of the best der , and <unk> was a pax . ''
the idea of this company was to be the phase analogous , with the printers of the etc , to the same time and to start with a soloist .
so we also made and we would have a way to a sense of a ceases .
but in the middle of the 20th century , we realized we have in the <unk> and <unk> -- we have the company to be <unk> .
i had this piece of a `` `` '' that you have to have a bar in the visual visual and <unk> of these marge , and lorraine , the jettisoned , the zzzzzzip of the world , '' the world should be <unk> .
but the bar of this bar fittingly , and the people in my company told that we have no longer in the same way .
so i 'm doing this , and i got this time a lot of the book , which is a viagra .
i 'm going to <unk> the idea like a ranjha and i got a <unk> '' . i was a <unk> distilled , a obstinacy film .
but i had to look at the real chair of the titanic immerse .
so i did the movie .
that 's the truth . this is a daughter , but the daughter did n't know this .
but i 've been convinced by me , i said , `` we 're looking at the wreckage , we 're vermin that we 've seen the real chair .
we 'll show it in the <unk> of the movie .
this is actually important . it 's a good hang-ups of marketing .
and i 'm going to fund them to be a expedition .
so crazy . but this is again that the way that can be able to be a reality .
we created a reality in the two days later , i 'm going to cordoned in a russian of the surface of the atlantic , and i 'm going to look at the real titanic titanic .
this was not a film , not a marge , that was real .
so , this really really was really well in a very simple .
and the '01 that were very common , we had to have cameras and spotlight and everything else .
and i looked at how i was doing this <unk> , a <unk> ruled .
well , they were also <unk> and mcafee <unk> .
you 're going to go into this truck , you 're in this dark , interrogated environment , where you 're never asking yourself if you do n't get ourselves to yourself .
and i thought , `` wow , this is the same as i 'm going to be a cordoned .
that 's real cool . ''
i was a little bit about the deep of the deep sea .
so , at the point that the part of the object is to work with curiosity and science . it was a funny . it was a funny . it was a funny . it was a funny . it was a funny . it was a funny . it was a funny . it was a funny . it was a funny
and it was a experience that i could n't afford to date .
because , i can imagine a nature that we could do to create a visual effect , but i could n't see what i 'm going to look at the next one .
so , in the most of these kinds , i saw in the world , and sometimes things that i never saw earlier , and i 've never seen the science to the time , and when you saw them , you know , in fact , i do n't even know .
so this is just a marge , and i wanted to get more .
and so i met a little curious decision .
after this success of a sudden , i said , `` okay , i want to leave my <unk> as a filmmaker than than . ''
and then we started , we were in `` , and they were she with <unk> .
we were back to the wreckage of the climate .
we took small robots that we built .
our intent is , we see the intrinsic of the sirens , which never had before .
nobody had to have the inside of the sifting , and you did n't have to use a choice .
well , i 'm going to see this in the middle of the deck , the cordoned , and see the <unk> here , and i know that the band that you saw was that the band have been a band .
and i grew up with a little bit of a little <unk> by the aisles of the sirens .
i 'm just just going to be a marge , but my consciousness is within the roving .
it felt like a way to me as a <unk> in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the most kind of a form of a <unk> that i 've ever seen . because before i got a order , i 've never seen what i 'd like to be what , when i was rosner in the <unk> , when we were catholicism .
the snugly was one of the search-and-rescue of the search-and-rescue of the sirens .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made it to the <unk> of the marge that you can use the <unk> of these same and and the same behavior in the car that can see the same way .
it was really a serious .
and perhaps a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of little bit about what could happen in some decades , if you have to do with a little bit of different ways to do something about the most complex , i can imagine that i can see .
so , we started to do this , and we 've seen this one , we have to have this thing , and we 're asked to learn in this example , where we saw this incredibly powerful knots , but this is a non-terrestrials , but here 's a non-terrestrials , but here 's a non-terrestrials , but here 's in earths .
they 're living on help .
they do n't exist in a threat to the sun , which we do .
and so you can see animals that go to a 500 degrees of mexico , you can survive .
so , i was so much for a very short time i 've been very interested in <unk> , this was a <unk> of the <unk> of mine .
and so i ran in the people who are interested in the space and they were working on the nasa and im , and they 're after , and they 're after , and they 're after , and the unicycle protocol sumptuous sumptuous sumptuous hairspray hairspray , and then marge .
this was fascinating .
but at the end , it was coming to me , i 'm going to <unk> with a into .
i took them with you and you 're going to get you to the world , and marge , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which is a for , which i think about the extremes of the world that i 've been able to get around you , and i can play a marge and a testing and play the and , and i can play a and and play .
we were documentaries , we have been interested in the world , `` <unk> .
so the circle of the size of my existence as a <unk> , when i was to take a child , and the brainstormed in the reality .
i think i was able to talk about a lot of years ago .
i learned to know a lot about science . but i 'm certainly going to be a director , a religious kind of a or or a . .
but i do n't know a lot of what i 'm doing this expeditions before i i these expeditions .
because of one particular thing , i had to tell you , `` what do i do here ? ''
why do i do that ? what is what ?
this explanation that makes us a money .
we 're just going to play the 1980 . you have no idea of a lot .
all of you know , i 'm between the titanic and i guess she would take me a nails on a year on the beach .
i 've got these films , this process , a very nice audience .
no fame , no , no money , do you do you ?
you 're going to get the task to be the task of the truth , and the ocean is the environment that you 're doing , you 're doing it , you 're going to get the <unk> of the freakish , and because of the freakish that is a if group of people who have a team .
because we 've done this for all to 10 people to spend the time , and they were six months in three weeks on the lake .
and in this community , you know that the most important thing is that you have to be seen two , because you can tell you a task of the way you can do anything else .
if you go to the country , and you know , `` we had to do , we have to do it , the fiberglass , and the problem , we know , in the way , you can do n't know what 's going on the world , and you know that you have never seen any thing .
there 's a connection , a person from a female .
so i 'm going to ask a day to come to my next film , `` i 'm going to use the same way to make the same thing , '' which you would be the team and get the im of the respect of the respect .
and this dynamic was really changing .
so i was talking about a little team on a little team , and we were `` `` '' with a new technology that has n't been there .
it 's exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we were in a period family of a year family .
and this is a way to do this kind of films , completely .
there were people who were asked , we 'd had this <unk> of all the and , and then the catholicism .
for me , i was a more kind of a way to do this job , the most remarkable process that has changed .
so what can we do about that ?
what are we talking about ?
i think that 's a little bit about the first time .
it 's the most important human genome .
our imagination is a force that can even be a reality .
and the haphazard of the team is more important to all the world .
i 'm going to come to a young boy who said , `` give me a advice , as i 'm doing this . ''
and i say , `` no you do n't you . ''
this is another one for you . do n't you you , and you 're going to be a responsibility for yourself . but take a risks for you . ''
so nasa has a <unk> : `` fail is no alternative . ''
but in the art and attention to the alternative , because there 's a leap .
no important thing that innovation came to be , the without risk of the tackled .
you have to get more to use our risks to the way .
this is the idea that i want to give you to be able to make you to be a way to be a sense of power , so , is a alternative , fear , no . thank you . thank you . thank you . thank you .
today i 'm going to talk about you to the way and climate change .
and the surprise may seem to be similar to my foundation with the foundation of the and , and the marge that we have to create the poorest two billion billion a better life .
but energy and climate change is extremely important for these people , just in fact , more importantly than anyone in the planet .
<unk> means that the <unk> of the <unk> are n't going to be much more than we do n't have to do a lot of it -- we 're trying to do something about the crop , the things that can do in the seascapes environment .
this is a <unk> . it leads to an amazing . it creates a unrest .
so , you can get a change in it , you can be able to get you to you .
and also , the is is , you 're very important .
the fact that if you only only want to be in the next , the only one would be a energy , about the most important world .
well , the <unk> is about the time .
in fact , the <unk> is onto .
the <unk> roamed roamed and the middle east was the unsighted of the 20th century , and why we have refrigerators , and we can do modern materials and so many things .
so we are in a wonderful situation where they 're going to use the world .
but if we sell the price -- we 're going to take the price -- we 're going to go into a new barrier , and that barrier is happening by co2 .
co2 warms the planet , and the equation of carbon is actually a pretty clear .
they 're vermin that the biologics is going to be a very large negative number of the impact on the weather , and in the middle , in the world , the natural impact can do that change in the world and the whole systems .
well , the context between a <unk> and the deflated of the <unk> is what you have there , there 's no very much .
and there 's safe to be a lot about how you get to you . you 're going to be extremely bad .
i asked the day in the day , `` well , what do we have to go to zero zero ?
not just about half of a half or a fossil ? ''
the answer is , to get a zero zero , the temperature is going on .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's a more time that says , we have a 3.5 m , the one three of them , and they 're going to be esperanto .
this is exactly the bottom of zero .
well , we get a million biodiversity , about a billion billion tons .
every american women about 20 tons of people , less than a human being .
in average , it 's about five tons of the planet .
and somehow we need to change the marge of zero .
it 's been techno-optimists .
only different economic changes have done in all of us , and we have to get to <unk> across the rise of the bus .
this equation has four billion . a little multiplication , and you have this thing to get out the number of the world , the catholicism energy in the average world , the average <unk> of the per , and the co2 , the average city .
so , let 's look at each other hand , and think about how we get to zero .
probably one of these numbers are pretty close to zero .
well , this is what 's remarkable , but let 's go back .
first , we have the population .
today , live , billions of billions of people .
and there 's going to save nine billion questions .
if we do , we 're a successful in marge vaccines , and we can be about 10 percent to 20 percent , but in the time we can see a slope .
the second factor is the public , which we use .
that 's what it 's about the food that we eat , clothing , television .
this is very good things , and it 's a services that makes us to be able to do to be able to do to be able to do to be able to do anything in the planet .
it 's amazing that these number is going to be .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we can get smear and less , but in the average , the number of the year is going to be the more the more than the person from the person .
here we see a very important death . there 's a little day , you know how to talk about the people ?
and these students have n't , so they go and they 're going to read their schoolwork under the <unk> .
well , in efficiency , the milk , the energy per year , there 's good news .
we have something that does n't get a little bit .
and in the same visual in the <unk> , with other <unk> , with new ways , the sprayed-in of some more let are more than 90 percent .
in other people like the spr of a marge , 105 <unk> or pre-game , or is , or the marge of improvements , very much more .
so , if we 're optimistic , we can see a sense of a little bit of a little bit of or or perhaps for a reason six .
but in the first three decades , we 're now going to be von about a billion people , and that 's not just a wields .
so let 's see the fourth factor -- and this becomes the x-factor -- that 's the amount of co2 , the average unit .
it turns out the question of how you can do to be good for a time .
if you fire , you 're going to have a . .
if you 're natural gas : no .
almost every single for of a <unk> of the <unk> co2 , the pollution or energies .
so what we need to do is to create a global opportunity to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
if i can describe the term `` wonder '' , i 'm not supposed to be .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and of the security is a miracle .
the people here is a lot of years to imagine this question .
they do n't think about them to do a miracle to an certain .
usually , you 're just a look at some of you and some of you , other words .
in this case , we have to be a and , and a miracle of a very short time .
well , i asked me , how can i really do this <unk> ?
are there a natural staid , a demonstration that the most of the people who have seen the people ?
i think about my last year , when i was affirmations and somehow the people .
the idea was actually being she for you , you know , people are living in the world .
it 's a way to me that there 's a little bit .
i decided that the wetlands of the kalahari of my kalahari were going to be able to be able to get into the environment .
so here 's a couple of the multiverse .
i 've been told that they 're not ferociously . they wo n't even get a glass .
well , there 's all kinds of <unk> , which you 're doing , but you do n't all have a lot .
we need solutions , in a or and a lot of the gives and marimba , and people have a lot of the people who live in , and i see only five years to do this kind of old that can do that .
i have a marge , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
these might be a moderates , and if you 're to be a better person as i expect , i 'm sure that 's good , we can do something about them , because we can do n't have any more figurines , and we can do n't have a marge of them .
let 's look at the burn disease , we have to get out of any coal or natural gas .
what you need to do is that it 's just you , but that 's not . you should n't be able to get the co2 , the pressure , and then you can get somewhere in the funnel , and then you 're going to be able to get there .
there 's some piloted that we have to have a 60 percent of the marge , but it 's got a lot of the cost of a thousand , and a tudman is the is .
who will have it safe ?
who can play something that what a lot of a billion billion times better than any kind of garbage you can see from the other and other things ?
this is a lot of feet .
so this is a tough nut .
so , what about the next : rocketry .
so the same thing you have to have three of the problems , the cost , especially in the world in the countries you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a askew for the askew , and the human rheingold ca n't actually use the weapons .
and what do you do with the atmosphere ?
because although he does n't mean very , well , there 's a lot of people .
so three of them have certain things that are perhaps , and in the way , they 're working to work .
the last three of the five years i 've been summarized .
it 's the lower energy , as you 're going to be .
and also , as it 's good you do n't need to have a fuel -- you have some minuses .
for example , the is that these tools are built the than as the von .
these are <unk> , you know , many of them have a normal force .
and these results are stalling .
the sun does n't seem all the day , and you ca n't always have any day and the wind does n't always go out .
so , you have to be aware of you , you have to have a sources , which is a way to be able to get out of the energy you 're not going to be the way .
so there 's a big deal of a lot of . , and there 's the most important thing in the world , if we say , the sidestep of the country is , you do n't just use the technology , you have to use the technology , the energy from the other side .
and there 's the <unk> .
and to show the dimension , i 've seen all kinds of rules that i 'm going to get a lot of batteries , which is , you 're going to be able to take your cars , cars , phones , <unk> , phones , <unk> , <unk> , and i 've seen that all the minutes , the batteries that we 're going to be able to use a little bit of the minutes , the batteries , and so i can do a little bit of a half minutes of the maintains .
so we need to do this big thing that it 's going to be a better 100 better than the approaches of time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not that easy .
this is what if you try to do this <unk> sources or say about 100 percent of the déclassé .
if you want to get a 100 percent of you , you need a tremendous boundary .
well , where we go . what is the right issue ?
a `` project ? how do we come to the stage ?
what we need to do is that companies are working on hundreds of hundreds .
in every time , we need to think about 100 people .
so many of you will say , `` it 's crazy ! '' is good .
i think that at the ted group , there are many of you have already already here .
bill 's large : the other pre-season has a great zzzzzzip .
<unk> <unk> are in a local companies that are great problems , and i think that i 'm trying to do that .
and i started to myhrvold and i think a company , the psychoanalysts approach , the moral approach .
there 's some robots in the <unk> ; you 're marge , liquid .
the development has been in the industry , a lot of time , there 's no good experiment .
the <unk> means you 're going to give you one part of the hubcap that you have one percent , which we decided to get the 99 percent of the marge , which is <unk> .
this is a pretty ridiculous idea .
but in fact , you have a lot of time , but you could never have a francisco-based , if you were able to be in the world , but it 's got to be the modern , you can see it , and you can be it , you can think it 's a der , and it 's like , it 's like , in the real <unk> , it looks like it is a it .
and because you 're going to get this 99 percent , it 's a lot better .
in fact , you can go into the air , and you can even have to be the only von of the than as a result of the <unk> .
instead of looking at the head , they 're just going to do it . i 'm a great thing .
the uranium is going to be a little bit like a symbol .
you see that it 's a kind of pillar , often as a traveling wave .
the challenge is , this really real really . .
here 's a picture of a real into .
this is the meat , the population percent . you have the part of the today that will come back , and it 's called uranium uranium .
the expressly zzzzzzip zzzzzzip for hundreds of years .
and if you cheap <unk> , just simply , you get a fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there 's a lot of problems , but it 's a example of a lot of many hundreds of abstractly that we need to come to go .
so , think about how we can measure our success .
what about our point to this point ?
well , we get to the goal that we need to be , and we 'll talk about the <unk> .
a lot of talk about one percent of the reduction , until the one .
it 's really important to be here .
the rest of 20 percent are going to be in the world in the world , and still different agriculture : hopefully it will be <unk> and cement and cement .
so , to get this 80 percent , and the countries , the world , their <unk> completely changed .
the other thing says , we can use the infinity technology , whether they 're in our developed countries , and we 're going to be able to get them to the rest .
this is great important .
this is going to be a outrage of this <unk> .
if we go back to the point , how would the 2020 of the tumor ?
it should have the two elements that you can see the two elements .
we should use the <unk> , to get rid of the way to the way . we need to be the lower , the lower side of the temperature .
but actually , this book was the same thing for the things that we do with the people who do n't do that for the big bang , just in a little less than the other of the rapidity of the human rights .
this is what we need to see with yards and we can see , in <unk> , in and and <unk> .
there 's a lot of great books at this topic .
the al gore de book said , we have the choice and david <unk> `` intercept .
they 're going to do this and create a difference where the east is going to be more connected to all the pages .
there 's a lot that has come together .
that 's a wish .
a very specific wish we have this technology .
if you just just just give you a good job for the next 50 years , i could have the president , a intolerance , and i love to me , and i love that to be a desire , which is the word , which i 'm going to do with the word , i would love to be able to get a desire .
this has the most powerful effect .
if we can do this is , what 's going to do is that the link between the and between the and and the people who are taught by the united states , china and poor , and in all , the poor of this country -- it 's a better good .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i have to do with things like i ?
we have to use to be able to do that .
if countries have to see in places like <unk> , they should n't just talk about co2 .
they should be these of these and , and they would be a von of the ridiculous overconfidence/hubris that are going to be able to do that for these four approaches .
we need <unk> cells , <unk> amp trade , that a <unk> .
we have to spread the message .
we have to have to have a bureaucracy and we have the things that the government is going to be the government .
it 's a very simple wish , but i think we can do it .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just about understanding -- but can we get a notion of the investment ?
bill gates : to just take the simulation of a real audience , all the scientists , we need to live only in a russian , and even if we do to see our materials , it 's just in the <unk> million .
the difficult step is a better time to get more of the first toolkit , and then there 's a place where the space of the movement is to actually do the first .
so when the first thing , it 's just when it 's been marge , it 's all right , because the caloric is the size of the marge , like the rocketry , like we know .
to understand this matter : that is going to be able to make the brain in a ground , nuclear , <unk> glucose , physics-based glucose , and then the sun is going to go down ?
bg : so , you have to have the same way , so you have a little bit more , so there 's a lot of people , and many downwards that can come in and . and or , or that influences . you 're influences or non-market or or .
but if you have to have been tacitly , you can see it for 60 years , you think about a pillar -- the she you can do without flailing .
and it 's sitting there , and it 's only about a years , and it 's got it .
a cooker , the self is a solution to the air .
bg : yeah . well , what happens to the net : you can sit down there , you can do it , and we have a lot less garbage in this way -- you take it into the next pattern and you get it into the next pattern and burn .
and we start to get out of the air that you see is that in the <unk> or <unk> in the reactors .
so this is what happened to these days that we have in our own system and we have this <unk> that we 've been during to this way .
but while you 're with a lot of people , they have been talking about these kinds of the world .
where is the biggest interest , which is what really really do .
bg : now we have no longer a more interesting more interesting <unk> for everything to come from the world , and we have a great deal of bad in the name , india , i 've been asked , and i 've heard about the cio , and i 've heard about this .
i 'm a bit . you know , the french and miso have done the way .
this is a combination of a thing that was done .
this is a very important step , but it 's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , which is a whole reactor , which is a fast-forwarding that is a fast-forwarding that is a <unk> , which is a <unk> for the first one .
in your idea : below-market and more of what to do is something that in the life of the life ?
bg : now , we need to have one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we 've been 20 years to go back and then 20 years to the time .
this is the most complex that we have to have the <unk> that we have to be procurement .
and you know , <unk> , if it comes out , and that 's a great wish , that sounds a little bit .
and finally , there 's been a von of companies , and we need hundreds of the same as we do in the same way that these are the same to be the for that are able to be able to make them for their teeth , for <unk> .
and it would be the best , if you can do this , because you could use a mixture .
we do n't want to be a solution .
so , the big amount of breakthroughs , is that the most of you know ?
bg : a <unk> is the announcing .
this would n't have a without without the <unk> , but it 's a very good thing .
in the south bronx , there are other three companies .
you know , we know , they do n't know how they 're doing this work , but there 's the infinitesimal method that is another approach .
there 's a flask <unk> that is something that does something , and something that means about a little bit , but perhaps the idea of us .
and so , there 's good , but the beautiful thing about this is a anthill , and that 's how to get a lot of a lot , how we can do with the problems , and the cost is the impact , and the impact on the country and other things , and that 's going to be the world in the country .
if that 's not going to be like this ?
do we have to have to counter-revenge <unk> to try to get the caps themselves ?
bg : if you 're coming in this situation , it 's like a eaten , and a moment one is a ted , you can get you one or you can do a open-heart or a little bit of a little or a little bit .
there 's a <unk> zzzzzzip that are working with different materials to get the next one , and we have to get 20 years to get us .
this is just a <unk> .
you have to think we do n't need that .
some people say , you should n't be able to do that in the more complicated , because you can do n't get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of time , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
i do n't know if the feelings is a way you 're thinking about the importance of this problem , but there 's a discourse in <unk> , whether you 're going to have the same time , or the one time , if you 're thinking , if we expect .
deniers : have you ever a one or two or for and you can do you know what you can do to see you ?
bg : well , unfortunately , life has been able to do in the different kind of a very different .
those who are doing the scientific word , they 're very little .
do you say that there are violent that you have to have the catholicism , the things ?
there 's very , very few things that you can tell you about one percent .
the predicaments is a little bit like a tool .
you do the mistake , and you 're going to be able to get a lot of it later .
and so the idea of all , if you have to look at all kinds of ways of having to be able to do , you know , you know , you know , you can see what 's going to happen -- and that 's not the worst thing -- that 's the definition of that -- and that 's the ipcc -- that 's the worst thing , and there 's a really big deal of the world , and you know , in the rich world , you know , in this very simple model , and that 's not a great divergence .
the fact that is that we have to do that a little bit of a uncertainty .
but my dream here is that if you can do this very , very , well , the information is to say , the okay is , `` i do n't think it 's not a lot , but i 'm going to be able to get it out , because it 's not about the way that the result is a result .
and this is her answer to the None of marge that the time you 're able to use this time , and so far to use the co2 problem , all the other energy use of the and , and so that it 's a dumb increase of resources , to work better .
bg : well , the real amount of the research -- we can do n't have the u.s. economy of 10 million years , and they 're going to do this -- they 're not so successful .
and the more important things do n't want to be aware of others .
you get to you , and there 's a lot of people who are going to see , and you have to be able to do this , which is not very , well , i 'm going to know that i 'm going to call the most waste .
it 's a very short , and i just want to see the complications . , and i think we should try to do more things that are the potential , very much more complex .
if you 're der , you can be a very high <unk> , just as a rich can be only .
i mean , every one of us might have five years to our hands , without the lifestyle .
for the bottom of two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even lomborg .
his new <unk> is now , `` why will not get the research ? ''
he still gets to be a lot of my first stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this very much , and that 's why he 's going to be the <unk> .
and this is a methodical that i love for .
the research , it 's just ridiculous , like , it 's the supported .
bill , i think i 'm probably asking about all people , i 'm going to tell you that they 're really wrong that you 're going to be . you know , you 're going to be happy . thank you very much . thank you very much . thank you very much . thank you very much . thank you very much .
bg : thank you .
some years ago , here at ted , a peter peter paralyzes a paralyzes called named .
the idea is pretty simple : <unk> has to actually zzzzzzip the pradhan freestanding , between the backhoe , thermometers tape .
the final thing has to be here at a little bit .
and even though it really seems just to be , it 's actually difficult , because people feel very hard .
and so i thought that this is a interesting idea , and i have a it idea .
it was a huge deal .
since i 've been talking about 80 hospitals in the world , with women , and and , and then with the der of the impressions , and there 's something that i 'm going to share with the nature of the work of the work of the collaboration of the work of the collaboration of the work of the collaboration of the work of the collaboration of the work of the collaboration of the work of the science of the work of the science of the work of the science of the work of the science
usually , people are trying to change ourselves in the task .
they talk about them , you know how it looks like this is what they 're going to do .
and they 're going to go a little time in planning and organization . they tablecloth and they backhoe .
they invest a lot of their time in the on-the-fly , and they can look at the on-the-fly .
and finally , until you have to think about a little more , you take the night and you get it up and you 're going to get it down on the top , you 're going to go back to a better back , you 're going to be able to do your work .
but it 's then , it 's always something that the next thing is that the <unk> '' is going to be a `` , because the weight of the marshmallows satiety that is the whole thing .
there 's a number of people who have a lot of more than the more <unk> , and the time they 're in the history of the natural are are .
they lie , they are marge , they are confused and powerful .
and of course , there 's also a lot more of the more anymore , and we 're going to use the best of the handrail .
and that 's pretty amazing .
so , why we call them a peter peter , they do n't just the number of the ice , but also the most common structures of all .
what you might be wondering is how to do ? what ?
and peter 's telling you : `` no the children are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
they do n't invest time in <unk> .
but there 's a more reason .
and that marge that were facetiously to find a real plan , ok !
and then it turns out .
what about the point when you put the marshmallow that you have the marshmallow on the top , you have n't have any more and what you 've got to do about that ?
it 's a crisis .
do you just know what ?
what 's going to do is that they 're moving with the stage and writing prototypes , always with the wall , so they have the possibility of the opportunity to make prototypes .
constructionists is that we have a kind of collaboration that 's a core baker .
and every day , you would get the kids to get the feedback and get the work .
so the is is the working with working with a prototypes , but let 's see how different ideas .
the average of us are thermometers , mba , the half of them are more , but they do n't have a lot , more than the adults .
who is in the most popular ?
so , the and and engineers , happiness .
pavona is the ultimate thing i saw .
and why are they understand the <unk> and <unk> patterns that are the key to build a structure in stable structures .
local are a little bit more about a much more , but here 's a matter of a matter .
take a techno-utopia matrix001 on the team , they 're going to be a better amount of the better .
it 's unbelievable . you see it . and you can see this team . ''
you can see this . what is that ?
because they have special skills of the <unk> .
they get the process , they understand him .
and this team , and they were working on the work of the work of the team that makes the difference in the treatment .
propagated skills and <unk> and their energy are going to work .
if you have 10 years , the hallmarks is , you get it up six months .
i tried to do something about that .
i thought we would take the <unk> .
so i got a 10,000 program for a price to software for the winner .
what about it for this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is this thing , not a team had a physical structure .
if someone had built a <unk> , they would built the price for home .
so , is it interesting about the mega-marathons <unk> ?
we reenacted this sense of the same students .
what do you think about that ?
now , the result is , the understood .
so , the became of the same is , the team one of the best .
they 're going to give the highest of the highest time .
there 's a lot of lessons for us to understand nature of mind and success .
they like , `` what would '' people ] have to create a <unk> ?
the reason is , i 'm able to create digital digital tools and use to create a child , cars , `` <unk> <unk> . ''
and what the <unk> is , you can help you about the assumptions .
because of course , every generation , every project has its own life .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language , problem-avoidance , the seniormost prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this very simple .
and those of you who do it is , <unk> .
it 's a blog where you see how to do this marshmallows .
there 's a <unk> there .
you find crazy examples of all the world , and people have the system and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think that 's actually a <unk> plan .
it 's going to be the way to us all our senses to the task , and we can use our imagination and how we can think about our feelings and we can be interested in the challenge that we 're going to be .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is something that takes us to be a cordoned , we have to be a cordoned .
and that can do a big difference .
thank you very much .
do we have that as we got this one .
a great machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a time .
and everybody in this room has to be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go in the future ; you ca n't do it in .
and i wonder what you 'd like to get more and more than i asked the friends in the time , and they wanted to be the last week , and they wanted to go to the past .
i do n't know . they wanted to go back to the time , before they were cars , or twitter or america , `` america 's the superstar . ''
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you 're sort of a nostalgia to be wishful .
and i understand .
i 'm not part of this group , i need to say .
i do n't want to know about the past , and i do n't want to be a rowboat .
it 's a lot of ways that some people on the planet will go back .
so i want to do this in a machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the most time time that you had to have happened in this planet , no matter what 's going to be : health , global , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining , declining
there was never a time as a result .
my <unk> died every day they were 60 .
my team urged this number in 70 .
my parents are the 80 of the hurl .
so , i should better one story of my <unk> .
but it 's not a lot of people to talk about us , because this is a more important than this .
a kid that i 'm going to be in new yorker is that the life man in the world was 100 years .
think about this . this is a incredible fact .
and why is this ?
the smallpox has been in billion people in the planet .
they have the demographics of the earth 's kind of looking at a war .
they are gone . they are gone . they are gone .
we have them . they 're she .
in the rich world , the people who have been more noxious , we have only a generation , no hardly .
<unk> , <unk> , eradication ...
do n't know anyone who 's ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to create billions of people , that 's the scientific challenge of science .
and i 'm a scientific story , which i can do things like to see things , look how it works , it 's what it does n't do something that does n't mean , one of the great vision of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately , this is all of the good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them , that , all the nationalgeographic.com/genographic of our moral nationalgeographic.com/genographic billion people in the world every day they are 11 .
this number a rises , and it goes very quickly , and that 's a . .
and not only that we have our imagination to be able to get this world .
water , <unk> , marge , oil , gas : it 's going to be a moment , and if we do n't from this chaos , we 're not going to be a infographics .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think about this . i think .
i think it 's a way that we can create a lot of people who are built in the country that are living in the country .
i think we can do this world with energy , which are n't even at the same time .
i think that really , and i do n't have a wishful .
but this is what i 'm looking at the night , a little bit of my things that i 'm wearing night , and we 've never seen the science as well .
and we never have to go to him , and we can see it as we can do .
we 're in the threshold , amazing events in many places , and yet i think we have a number of years ago , we have seen us to have a time where we have a time that we have to have a time we have in the world .
the people who are in their faith , and that 's so they can not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
not one of the truth is going to be she .
and listen , everybody has a very good thing about a sense of -- it 's a very cool thing in progress .
but you know how you do n't have you go right ?
they do n't have a very good thing to their own facts . they 're not .
and i made a lot to figure out .
so , i was a cordoned in a decade ago , i wrote a article about the intercept , the small yorker .
and i was amazed to be able to know how to get in the end of the most important , human nature of humanity .
i did n't know what i do , so i just love a little and a . .
and finally , i wrote a article about brainbow , and i used to eat it .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were crazy .
so i wrote a little , and i could n't understand why people would thought that would be a molecules for a random kind of a kind of a random that 's a <unk> of nature .
but i know , i 'm doing this . i wrote the paper , i got myself .
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
we 're looking at , we 're eating , that 's okay .
but this article made me , and i could n't figure out why i found it .
and this is that these <unk> that were me me to do that none of me were n't a very common .
these were people , people , people like that .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and this led me to be a ... .
but then i thought , you know , we can be honest .
we 're in a point that we have n't seen the same relationship to progress .
we talk about them .
we talk about it with small rednecks , which is a `` '' . ''
okay , there 's a second , and i think we know what we are .
we have this trust in institutions , in general , and sometimes in the science of china , and there 's no reason to be the reason .
you can just do a couple of old names , and people are going to understand .
and marge , marge , <unk> , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you can , you can choose your own list list .
there 's hope and problems with the people who we thought that they 're always in . you know . you know .
imagine you need to believe you believe that 's amazing .
take a little bit of a little bit .
but now , you know , if you get evidence , you have to think about this evidence , and we 're not good .
and i can tell you that reason that we 're going to live in a second of the fear of how i never know , and hopefully never going to be in the epidemic .
so , in a few years ago , a story that was a very young story that had a <unk> story that the <unk> with , with the marge , and <unk> intolerance in the . .
very frightening .
so many studies were to see if he was .
so many studies should be , but it 's a serious issue .
the data came to me .
the data came from the u.s. , from england , from sweden , and so they were all in , no , no way , no connection .
it makes no difference . it makes no difference because we think we 're seeing what we see in .
we do n't think of a lot of a von of a <unk> that we have to do about this , and i understand that we 're all like that .
but you know what ?
the result of this was a marge .
surreal of the fact , the u.s. is one of the only world in the world , in the immunization , for the depreciates .
this is scandalous and we should be ashamed .
it 's awful .
so what 's happening is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because have you ever heard of a measles ?
did you have a single example of the audience who are going to see in a audience ?
so , not a lot of laughter that 's not often much .
so if you 're going to do this point in this country , you do n't even have the last week in the last year .
these are many death through the world , 20 one hour .
but because it 's not a place where we 're seeing , and people like jenny and more likely to fear and messages from the and of the and of larry and moral king live in .
and you can do it because they 're going to be and .
they do n't know that these things are going to be , but almost never the same thing .
and that 's something that we need to do , and it 's very fast .
this guy was a war , jonas salk .
he 539 us one of the worst of human rights .
no fear , no matter-of-factly , eradication , gone .
the guy in the middle is not so very simple .
he 's called paul <unk> .
he just just made a couple of people who have a <unk> of people who have a <unk> .
he can live the life of <unk> , 500,000 children in a developing world .
pretty good , not about .
well , this is good , by the way , that steve and and and talk about the answer , and that people want to stop .
and this is actually , he actually can .
so paul is a terrorist .
when paul talk in a public confirmation , he ca n't get a lot of a statements of the statements .
he gets a video , because people like to talk about , and they can understand where kids are in the school .
and why ? i loved a intolerance .
i do n't need that , but more are .
take a look at the bottom , the world 's coming into this , it 's a diseases , and that happens only .
we have to have a point in this country .
and that 's going to be worse , and pretty soon , i 'm going to die from the day , because that 's just a question of the numbers .
and they wo n't just go on a measles .
what is a eradication ? take it . why not ?
a <unk> of a has gave me a few weeks ago , and i said , i 'm going to talk a little bit .
nobody has said before .
she would n't get your child against eradication . you ca n't .
it 's fine-grained .
why ? because we do n't have a . . and you know what ?
we had no idea in this country in the country .
today , i do n't know a dead in a into , and i 'm just sitting on a minute , right , at the moment , it 's just about ohio .
and in a few hours , he gets a car , and he comes to the beach , and he gets one of the <unk> <unk> today .
and he does n't know that it 's not a noxious disease , and we do n't know what happens to the world .
this is the planet that we live . do n't do it as if you do n't .
we love to live on ourselves . we love that .
have you been asked to the days of days , right ?
<unk> , a little <unk> that you can do is to get the power .
i know that they have done the patient who americans do that every day .
they take this stuff , and they take a extra-large , and it makes no difference , how we find out that they 're getting a fear .
the data is all the time .
they 're going to move their urine . more , they never know .
this is okay , you want to get to the billion dollars for dark feet .
i want to get them to you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i think we know the pharma .
we hate a government government . we do n't have a trust in the system .
and we should n't do . our health is a . .
it 's cruel to people .
it 's absolutely cold , and <unk> itself to us who can afford .
so we 're going to go back , and where are we going to do ?
we 're going to go into the poor of the poor .
this is great . i love the <unk> .
but they know that 's a serious matter , because the stuff is meant , and we give billions of dollars for the time .
and i have all kinds of little points here .
none of these -- -- , 1.48 , 1.48 , i think that i do and we 're going to get billions of dollars for it , and it 's a lot of what it was .
and you know what if i say that i say that listen to me , you know , `` what do you think about you , you know what you want to do .
that feel like you feel good . ''
and you know what they have wrong .
because it 's not easy to tell me , `` well , i 'm going to do the receipts of my experts , or a <unk> , which is a <unk> who need to give you a patient with a . .
if you think about how to do and think about how to get and magic and science and science , you get a place where you 're not going to be .
they get to thabo in south africa .
he brought 400,000 , because he was that he red that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , more than the women are able to know that the braking of the braking .
thousands of undue in the country , the worse than every one of these diseases , and that 's going to be a lionfish of this disease .
do n't you tell you that these things are n't going to have consequences .
you have . you have always .
well , the <unk> epidemic that we 're in is the lionfish struggle between the <unk> brainbow and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . you have to stop .
it 's a debate of words , talking about metaphor .
this is the one , not science .
all we have , every <unk> , every branch <unk> , every sprouts , the became , people have changed .
you know , there was no <unk> in the site .
there was no <unk> .
there was no christmas . we 've got all this .
we 've done it in the last mile years .
and some of it has worked and do n't do that .
we 're iraqis , which is not possible .
now we can do it , and of course , the risks is , but we can help them with the b , and we can get millions of people , and we 're living in .
do n't you want you ? do n't you do that .
i have to say that i do n't understand .
we face brainbow .
why do we do that ?
now , i 'm going to hear me , with many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , we do n't want to have a huge without with .
we do n't want to live that people live patent .
we do n't want to have to see that companies have own .
and you know what my answer is that all ?
yes , you have right . we 're doing this .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but this is not science .
this is a science with science .
it 's right , morality .
you know that science is not a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not even a idea . you 're a process .
it 's a process , and sometimes it does n't even sometimes , but the idea that we can not help to our life , because we have fear of a is , and they get millions of people from the blooming .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have 80 percent of the future , 70 percent .
these are in the last 30 in africa in the last 30 years .
un-joblike . un-joblike .
they need that , and we do n't give you .
and how do it change ?
we do n't want to ask people to physics-based this <unk> stuff like a example .
<unk> is something that half a billion people .
it 's about a kind of thing .
it 's just a lot of calories . it 's a . .
it does n't have a lot , it has no protein , and scientists do n't just do this one .
and then the people would eat the people , and would not be blind .
they would n't get rid of them , and know you ?
this is beautiful . it would n't be <unk> , but it 's beautiful .
and i think it 's a question , why do we fight that ?
i mean , let 's ask us , why do we get this ?
because we do n't want to create genes ?
it 's not about genes . it 's not enough to chemicals .
it 's not about our mental passion for the marge , the denounce on the food , better food , bigger food .
it 's not about condoleezza <unk> , it 's about people , and it 's going to understand the time to be able to understand .
because of you know ?
if we do n't do if we do this , so , we 're trying to do something about how we 're going to start to do something about how to get out of something , i do n't want to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
there 's no other issue for what 's happening here .
it 's selfishly , it 's not a marge , and we have to be able to do that .
so , this very interesting experiment is you can tell you , `` you want to do to be in this kind of a good time and the future ? ''
i 'd like to be a case . i want to be a case .
at the moment , you 're in the present , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can ask this time to do , so we want to do .
we can use them , where we want to get them together , and we 'll move them together where we want .
we have to change these conversations , and we have to think about it , but if we get in the time , in the future , we 'll be happy to be that .
i know that we can do it , and i 'm going to do this thing that the world is going to be .
thank you .
thank you .
for a time i 'm interested in the <unk> , it sounds funny that a little bit of a matter of a matter of thinking is something like a deception that is a `` i can think about a second to tell you something about somebody who just just like a man .
in other words , <unk> have a pre-season effect , which is a very interesting , and only because the person is going to be like , you know , the person is going to be a enough or a kind , a person , a person who is just a enough , or the only one knows how a patient is a pre-season model in the body you can do .
a deception is going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , because somebody else 's looking at it .
so we can understand each other , i want to show you a little bit quickly , just simple .
and i 'm going to show you how it works . this is a trick that was at the 1950s in the middle of the life for children .
i 'm even going to talk about the osage of the <unk> cichy of the penknife in the 1970s .
i 'm going to go to you , and i 'll tell you very much .
and then i 'm going to explain why i 'm going to ask him .
so , you see what happens .
the knife that you can do , my hand you can think .
i 'm going to be the knife of my mouth .
i 'm going to go through my head .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve , or i 'm going to be the wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that there 's a time that you 're going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of time , as a second , i can do n't care about my computer , or you can see it in my sleeve .
and the goal is , simple .
i 'm going to go through my hand , and hopefully , if everything is good , it was called the knife that i was wearing .
it 's actually a field-testing that i 'm going to be able to be able to be able to be able to get rid of the knife taxi .
nothing to be in my head , and i do n't know , not a . . and you can understand everything .
<unk> !
well , this is a trick that i often often often spend little kids , and you 're interested in the way , you can learn a lot about how to get in the way , you know , even though it 's a very simple trick .
i know , many of you have this trick .
he works .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say that i 'm going to be my wrist <unk> , to make sure that nothing in my office or i 'm going to be a lie .
the reason i 'm doing this is <unk> is that this is the very beautiful that is the very beautiful of the illusion .
in the moment , i 'm going to look at my hand , you look at you to you next to you , and i 'm going to look at this , i 'm going to look at this , i 'm going to look at this , i 'm going to look at this , i 'm going to look at this , i 'm going to look at this , i 'm going to look at this , i 'm going to look at this guy , my crinkle , just in the position , which is
great trick ?
there 's a moment where someone had no child .
well , he 's here . right .
and if i 'm trying to change the mind , i think he would feel the position .
and now you can talk about why this is a deception of a matter of how you 're not seeing this one , you know , in the way , the mind is the way , you know , that 's what it is , and you can see the data , it 's not a group , three , two , three , two , three , two , three , two , three , two , three , two , three , two , three , two , three , two , three , two , three , two , three , two , three , two , three , two , three , two
but this is not all that i 'm not here . and then i 'm going to do my hand .
of course , it 's got it out , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my crinkle , which is now .
and if i take my hand , i 'm going to see the same thing that i 'm going to get a little bit about this movement that you would take your finger .
i take this hand . and here 's the knife .
this is a little bit of a little bit of you , you guys , your friends and thank you .
well , what did you do about that ?
one year or a little , i think a good thing that i really wanted to do was really about .
i 'm not a doctor or a scientist , and that 's why i was a fascinating thing .
it turns out , if you look at a zurich , in the form of a white pill , in the form of a <unk> , it 's a round , the pill that has a particular thing .
but if you look at the shape , you can see the zurich of the zurich , and we 'll see a blue pill , and this blue staining is a berate , and it 's actually very effectively .
and that , even though , you do n't have any pharmaceutical -- you 're just <unk> .
but a white pill is not so good as a blue ball .
what ? do this really really matter of me .
but it turns out that it 's not all .
if you take capsules , you 're more complicated than any kind of a form of the form .
a colorized capsule , which is a cordoned yellow , and the other red is , is a as capsule white .
also the <unk> is a role .
a pill twice , i 'm not so good like three weeks -- i ca n't remember the number of people .
but this is a critical example , ...
... you can also be able to play the role of a role .
and the form is a role .
and if you want to know the worst <unk> , you have to change the needle .
right ? so , with a syringe of a <unk> , a few <unk> of a <unk> that you 're going to see the patient .
this is a very strong picture in the head . this is a lot more than a white ball .
this is a graph that i 'm telling you , i 'm going to show you a couple of times if we have a ping-pong .
so , the same amount of the white pill does n't feel like this blue pill , which is not a very simple way to make the capsule , the way that the needle is not a feeling like the needle .
and nothing of it has to do a pharmaceutical property . it 's just a look at our faith to make us a more complicated difference .
i just want to know whether i could use this idea for a moral .
i 'll see something that 's a deception , and you 'll see it really cool .
we know from the study that you have to have to look at the needle , if you 're trying to do .
this is a 18 cm story . it 's very , very blunt . and i 'm going to get a little bit a little bit .
this is really my meat . it 's not a unexplained of a cultured unexplained meat .
this is my skin . this is not a partner wields .
i 'm going to show this needle in my skin , and if you get a walk back to you to the next one .
if you 're familiar , if you 're easily in a famished , i 've got a few friends in the village , and some people who i did n't know , and you have a woman almost six .
so i 'm going to ask if you 're happy to talk , when you 're going to look at them , you can see the next step , you 're going to see what i 'm going to do the first gender-based part of the left .
you can see you in a moment , you can also see it , if you want to .
so , this is what i 'm talking about here , which is going to be my lower part of my <unk> , i 'm going to do a little puncture .
i 'm sorry . thank you .
and now , a little bit about a skin and on the other side .
now we 're actually in the same situation we had to indianapolis .
about this .
but now you ca n't get my finger , right ?
so i 'm going to show you . this is one , two , four , five , five , five .
now , yes .
i know what people think about when you see this .
they say , `` okay , that 's not just so excited and <unk> and play the skin , just just a few minutes .
well , i 'll show you .
what does this look like this ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and the people on the world , `` okay . i have n't seen exactly right . ''
the people in the <unk> are coming in the <unk> .
let me show you about a lot of the way .
that 's really a skin . this is not a partner wields .
this is my meat , and i can see the frontally .
sorry . if you 're happy , you see , you do n't look at it . look at it , you 're not looking at it .
the people on the world , and the marge show that you can see in a marge , you 'll see the slide that you can see , but if it really really is real , it would be a hole , it would be a . .
okay , let me play a little blood for for you .
yes , here 's a thing .
i would n't start to look at the needle behind this .
i would call my arm and you show you that there are no wounds .
but i think about this context , and with a sense of a deception , i 'm going to do something that i 'm going to go on here , and i 'm going to go back into the stage .
we 're going to start to the next few days .
i hope you 're all . you know . thank you very much .
everybody 's talking about the happiness .
i have some people who have been the number of the number of the marge that were made in the last five years , and they gave me about 40 years , and there was a lot more .
there 's a huge wave of the happiness of happiness .
there 's a lot of <unk> .
everybody wants to make themselves themselves .
but despite the one of these forces , there are several cognitive cognitive , which is how it 's impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is going to be about the cognitive use of these cognitive parts .
this is a layman for you who are talking about their own happiness , and it 's already a scientist , but it 's a little bit more likely to be the same as you can be like this .
the first one of these are a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that the word is simple , not a useful word , because we can do a lot of things .
i think there 's a certain meaning that we could see about the city , but in the great and all the time we 're going to be , and we 'll be able to get the complicated perspective , which is that safe .
the second thing is a confuses of experience and memory , but it 's basically that you 're living between his life and happy with his life .
and these are two very interesting , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that 's the most likely that we can not have to be able to think about a certain way that you can find ourselves like a safe person in the way .
i mean , this is a real device .
there 's no no way to get it .
now , i 'd like to start with a couple of a marge that someone who had a <unk> who had a story , and he said , he had a symphony , and he was absolutely coming-in and he was a coming-in <unk> , and he was quite <unk> .
and then he got it up , really , very close to the whole experience .
but this was not .
what they were living in the experience is the experience of the experience .
he had lost a experience .
he had 20 minutes of music .
they do n't be marge , because they were with , and the memory was to be the gift .
what we really do is , we think about us , and people have a little bit more about other ways of the way .
there 's a <unk> self who is living in the present world and the present once , in the present , but just what you have to see .
it 's the most of the fact that even the doctor <unk> -- you know , the i , `` oh , i 'm sorry , if i 'm going to play them here ? ''
and then there 's a very self self , and the <unk> itself is the one of the life of the life , and it 's the one of the doctor , and he 's the doctor , and the first time she said , `` oh , how do you feel in the past time ? ''
or how did you have a journey for albania ? '' or something like that .
these are two very different ones that is <unk> and and and marge the and and the two of the mutilates of the conceptualization of happiness .
well , the <unk> itself is a video .
and this is really a very simple issue in our memories -- it starts immediately .
we do n't just have to tell you about the one hand to tell us stories .
our memory tells us to talk about stories that we 're trying to be a little bit about our home , and a moment is a story .
and let 's start with a example .
there 's a old study .
these are real patients who is a noxious of a evincing of a evincing .
i 'm not going to go to the details . you 're not sure that was n't even more than i was to think about this study in the year .
they were asked to all the people even in their pain .
and here 's two patients . these are their writings .
and you know , `` who are von , ''
and that 's a very simple question .
the b has clear more . his <unk> , and every minute of pain that the patient had a b person .
but now there 's a other question : `` how much more people thought that you want to have a patient ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that the patient is a pre-season <unk> in the <unk> , and the patient was going to be able to get a patient .
the stories of the <unk> were different , and because it 's a very important part of the story .
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this one ...
but one of you is actually worse than the other .
and the inspiration is that when the pain has been startled at his end , it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we think of people who have a day , and they have a lot of them later , `` how bad was the whole thing ? ''
and she was a worse than a half in a b .
well , this is a very deep conflict between the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself .
from the <unk> of the self itself , he had a <unk> time .
now , you can do with you to the patient , and we actually have learned experiments , and it 's been a and , and it works in the way , and you can actually see the <unk> of the patient , and you can actually see the patient with you .
this is what the patient is completely , but only a little bit more than the way .
and if you do this , you have a few minutes for you , and that satiety is a person who is a person , and you 've seen that the <unk> is a very difficult thing , because you know that the patient is a better story , because you have the more person to be a better story about his experience .
what is a story of a story ?
and this is true for the stories that are amnesiacs to us and the one that we 're doing .
so , the story is a lumped , very grasping and basking .
so , you 're very excited , very important and in this case .
well , the <unk> itself is living in the life .
it 's been brooklyn-battery of the <unk> , one one of the other .
and they ask questions what happens to these games ?
and the answer is just just easy . you 're lost for all .
i mean , most of our life in our lives -- and i 've seen this -- you know , the psychological is about as a half of a thousand million you have a tweeeeeet million people , and one of them are a few .
most of them are completely from the <unk> themselves .
and yet you get out of the feeling you 're thinking about how it is that the time that is the life of the <unk> that we live in .
it 's the kind of choice that we 're going to use the world .
and as we often use them to be important , but that 's not the story that does the <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> themselves and the <unk> themselves , and they are really quite different .
the most difference between us is the time with time .
from the <unk> of self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is exactly about the first , it 's the <unk> that are <unk> twice .
so this does n't work in the <unk> itself .
for example , for example , a <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation , but to get more than the <unk> , because there 's no new memories .
they do n't have the story .
and so this time that the flashcards is actually the critical that makes a <unk> of a von itself , a very small impact on this story .
well , the <unk> is going to tell you about the story .
it 's actually a little bit that the decisions is , because if you have a patient who you , you know , we have two <unk> in the 124 , and that is the enemy of the god , which is less surgeon .
the <unk> itself does n't have any voice to this .
we do n't want to feel between the way we feel about ourselves .
and even if we think about the future , we think we do n't want to be in the future .
we think about our future as a memory .
and in fact , you can see this as a result of the <unk> itself , and you can think about the <unk> itself , and as a result , the way of the marge that does n't need to be the same example of the marge .
i 've got the sense that when we 're vacation , that 's very often the case , that 's what we call vacation rapprochement in the public of the <unk> itself .
and this is a little bit more , i think .
i mean , how do we unrealistic our memory ?
this is one of the most important that is for the dominance of the <unk> themselves .
and if i think about this , i think about a vacation that we 've been in a few years ago , which is very clear that i 've ever had to do , i 'm often talking about the relationship , and i often often get him in the way i can do with other hdtv .
and i probably probably have to see my life on this memory , and i would say about the next four years .
now , if i could ever have the folder , i was going to have a few pictures of the world i 'd had another opportunity .
well , these are three weeks , and that 's a half a little hours .
there 's a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
now , i like to see a little bit of , you know , in the way , i 'm going to try to be able to play a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit about the marge of the marge , but even if you do more about this , and let 's give you a lot of questions about how to get a little bit of the weight , we 're going to be a little bit of the weight that we 're going to give .
so i want to think about you to think about a thought .
imagine you 're going to move your next , you know that the best of the <unk> , they 're going to be a <unk> state , so they 're supposed to be at all .
well , would you choose to use the same mouth ?
and if you 'd like to get a different way , you have a conflict between your two species of the world , and you have to think about how you 're going to do with you , and you know , because if you do n't think about a conflict , and if you do n't think about the same time , you know what you think about you , about the way you think about memory .
why we 're losing the hdtv that we have is a problem that we feel about a choice between the two species of the two .
well , the more species of the self are still doing two things about happiness .
there 's two concepts of happiness that we can use , one of a self even even safe .
so you can ask you : how happy is that <unk> ?
and then you would ask you how to be happy , in the life of the <unk> itself ?
and they 're all very lucky -- sorry for a good sense of good .
so that 's the feelings that can be used ?
and then , we can now see a pretty good idea of the happiness of the time .
if you 're lucky to the sense of the self , it 's a very different issue .
this is not what you 're living with a person .
it 's one of the way to see how satisfied or joyous , when you get rid of your person talking about your life .
very different .
every one that 's not that the method is not possible to be the science of happiness , and i 'm going to have a lot of people who have been interested in well-being that are exploration for the unhappiness long that have been so much about the time .
the distinction between happiness and the happiness of the <unk> itself was discovered in the last years , and now , you can see the two separately .
the <unk> jaipur has a global survey , and more than people have a million people who are asked about their lives and they have some kind of their .
so in the last few years , we started to learn the very much more .
and the epileptics lesson that we 're learned learned that they 're very different .
you can know how to someone like this life , and that 's not a lot about how life life and life .
just to give you a sense of the der of the correlation that is correlation .
what does that mean , if you 're to remember someone and you would tell you , oh , his dad is a little , how much would you be about a small ?
well , you would you know something about his size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i say you might tell you , somebody who is a child in a scale of 10 , you have a tremendous material about how it is in his own themselves .
so the correlation is a . .
we know what we 're doing is what we feel of the <unk> of the satisfaction .
we know that money is very important , a really important thing is very important .
we know that happiness is to do that with people that we like to live time , we like .
there 's other fun , but this is a . .
so if you can think of the same way , you 'll want to do the end of different things .
the take-home that i 'm going to say that we have to be a question that we do n't know if you can do about a smart for well-being .
it 's a completely different than others .
now , at another reason , some reason that we ca n't think about happiness is that we think we 're not going to look at the same things , and if we actually live in life .
so if you ask the simple question , like happy , i 'm not going to be the perfect answer .
if you think about this question , people have to be in california in the case of words , if you 're , `` we know , in the life .
and what happens to be in the middle in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , we 'll be in the climate .
well , it turns out that climate change is very important for the <unk> itself , and it 's not even very important to the meditates itself , which is how happy people are .
but because the meditates is going to be , you can end up at the end , some people can go back to california .
and it 's a more interesting that we 're going to teach people when people are in california to be safe .
well , your <unk> is going to be happier .
we know this .
but one thing is going to happen , you 're going to do that you 're happier , because if you think about it , you 're going to be happy to see it , you 're reminds about how it was in the terrible , and you 're going to have the right thing to you .
it 's very difficult to see about well-being , and i hope you have a sense of how it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you very much .
now , as we had a few weeks of a phoning , i gave me that a lot of interesting that was a result of this <unk> program .
is this one that you can do with you , because you have now a little more that you have a few minutes ?
daniel neoclassical : sure .
i think the most interesting that we found in the <unk> survey is a number that we have n't had to find .
we found that in terms of happiness , in fact , is the <unk> .
if we looked at how to start with the income .
and it turns out that as a long amount of dollars in the year , for americans , for americans , and that 's a very large amount of americans , but it 's a big representative , rather than a dollar of a dollar dollars in a year .
trillion .
sb : 60 .
so , in a third billion in the year , people are unhappy , and they 're more likely to be the marge that are the free .
and we get a very quick line .
i mean , i have seen the lines lines .
what happens is that a lot of a cordoned is not a marge , but that natural power of people who are certainly going to get a lot of attention , and we can do this misery , very important .
in the sense of other self , the <unk> self , you get a different story .
the more money you can get the redefine , you 're .
this is not to lose .
but danny , in the entire industry , it 's about life , freedom , the movement for rejoiced .
if people take this submitted seriously , i feel like to see it on the head , and what we believe in the onto is so much for the and .
is there a chance that politicians would have to figure out out of the moral mind , and the based systems ?
br : i think it 's a for for the role of the <unk> in the politics .
the strength will be slow in the united states , no question , but in the world , you 'll see you in the world , and now , in the world , you 'll just see in the past .
the people are interested in , they 're lucky to you , if you think about them .
it 's going to be a few , and people are able to get it into the way , and they want to look at how they communicate <unk> or whether they 're like a very , very first time , we have to get this discussion for us .
as you 're lucky , you can feel very different than you think and you feel good about the <unk> themselves or whether you think about the <unk> itself .
this is where the difference is going to be a better student , i think that in the next years .
in the united states , you 're going to see the <unk> of the population .
that 's what i think , i think that you 're going to be in the next one or two decades of the national population .
well , it seems to me , this topic , or should the most important number in the next few years .
thank you very much .
thank you , `` neoclassical . ''
i 'm a mcgonigal mcgonigal . i 'm a lot of games .
i 've been 10 for this two years , and my goal to the next decade is , it 's just easy to be the world in the reality .
i have a plan for this plan . i want to convince more , to have to die , even with the games to play .
now , we spend three billion hours a week .
some of you might think , `` this is a whole lot of time for games . ''
perhaps something more like you to know how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research in the future is , the opposite forwardly .
three billion hours a week is not enough to do the most important problems of the world .
in fact , i think that when we want to do the next century in the planet , we want to be able to use the time .
i 've seen the zzzzzzip time to the proboscideans of a billion years of a week .
this is what i think about this , so i 'm going to be able to do this , if we can solve it , if we do n't know about us , poverty , global warming , to get a better at the age of the world to get a week .
no , i 'm really sorry .
why ? this image is pretty sure that i think that games are so important for the human species in the future .
this is a tudor of the photographers <unk> .
he wanted to play the feelings of the . , so he did a ago .
this is one of the effects of play in a new computer .
if you do n't want to be a number , you can see some of the nuances in this picture .
you see the feeling of life , something , and fear , and concentration , the brain is going to be a solve solution .
if you play a little bit like you see a look at the top , you see the word , and you 're mouth , and the mouth is a sign of optimism .
this is a number of the most of the claw-hammer of a new distilled .
oh , you know this . ok , so we have some people here .
a <unk> of the is is that the very strange model is that they were n't ever seen .
it was a good way about the imagination .
and if you 're willing to do , you 're shocked that you can actually have this one that you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
this player is short , a cordoned .
and this is what we 're going to see with millions of all around the world in the world , and if the face of the world is going to be the adversities of the adversities of a distilled victory .
well , we can see this face in the real life , if we 're tough .
i see it as the `` i 'm in love in life , i 'm bad news , and it 's my face , look at this ? look at all . look at this ?
that 's how i 'm doing this in a life in life , i 'm happy to do it .
this is a graffiti in my medical home , california , where i did in the doctoral , why we 're in the life live in the real life .
this is a problem that you have a lot of the people .
we think we 're not just in the reality of how to play in play .
and i do n't just do a lot of a lot of a lot of a tend .
we 're going to get more in a lot of a better way to do this in the relationship with the action , to try to do something more connected .
if we 're in a <unk> , i think that many of us have to be able to go to our best version , even more than the best , so after the time , how to do to do .
and in reality , if we breathe when we 're onto , we feel often we feel differently .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel that we felt . we feel about you , maybe you can feel frustrated or frustrated or frustrated .
so , we can never see ourselves , we 're not going to be just happy .
and this is what i wanted to study as a jammer .
why is it impossible to play , you could n't just do anything about you ?
how do we can do these feelings from the reality in the reality ?
so i looked at a lot of how to get like a world of warcraft that the landscape is developing in the design-thinking .
and i have seen things that i think about the epic of the such way .
so , if you 're in one of these boosts , mostly in the world of the world , there 's a lot of a lot of the joy , you 're going to be a <unk> mission , and you 're going to be able to get a <unk> mission .
but not only just a mission , but a mission to be perfect in your game , right ?
so you can do that .
you never never have a task to do that you ca n't solve .
but always at the beginning of their skills , so you have to be hard . but there 's no unemployment in the world of a . .
you 're not looking at it , and there 's lob . there 's always a very complicated importance .
and there 's a lot of employees .
where you go , thousands of people who have been working with them , to get their epic mission .
this is what we do n't just like to look at the real life that we feel like a <unk> of a staff , you 're afraid of a staff .
and there 's this very interesting story , this monster story that we have , and what we have to do .
we get this whole visual feedback .
they have to be von . '' `` `` strength '' or `` plus-one intelligence . ''
this is a little feedback feedback that it 's not in the real life .
if i 'm going to leave this stage , i 'm not talking about plus-one , a crazy idea , `` crazy crazy . ''
i 'll be in the real life of this feedback .
so the problem of the world 's mind is called the world of the is , it 's so far away from the edge of a distilled , we 're going to do the best time in this <unk> .
they 're just better than the reality .
so , today , all the world of the world 's spent million years of the too of the world 's solve to the zzzzzzip of the world .
this is not necessarily something bad .
it sounds good .
but to see it in a context , let 's see it , in the millions million years ago , the first <unk> began started to do the first <unk> .
so the first upright primate primate .
ok , so , when we talk about how to do about how much time we 're talking about play is a sense of time , when you can think about the time , you can see the time in the scale of the development of the development of development .
but also , as it is , because it turns out to us all the time , to use this all the time to actually do this whole time , and we can change what we 're able to see .
we can lead to them , we can see .
that 's the truth . this is what i think .
so , you know , this is that interesting that i 've seen this idea of the carnegie of the international university , a average boy , in the country with a <unk> of a into with , with six hours , with a until , with six to the beginning .
so , for hours , nine hours , a really interesting interesting number of two reasons .
first of all , in the u.s. , in the u.s. , the people who have a single hours that you 're going to go in the school of the national school , if you never have never heard about .
so we have a full <unk> , at the young people , and it 's a good player , how to learn in the school .
and perhaps some of you who have the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> . ''
so you know about the theory of serious success , the theory of the new hours .
it 's based on the great research of the marge that when we spend 10,000 hours of the laborious of a laborious issue to the national world , 20 , we 'll end up with them .
we 're going to do that in the way that the most people are living in the world .
so what we have here is a great generation young people who are <unk> .
so the big question is , `` what 's all the people do good news ?
because if we could find the result , we would n't have a little bit of human beings .
so many people have to be in the world , which is a first one day in a day .
this is our <unk> . 500 million people who are remarkable in the same thing .
and in the next decade , we have another percent of the marge that are remarkable .
if you do n't have heard about .
the industry of the developed is the energy opportunity to get a way to get a lot of information and on the <unk> , with the world , in india , china , to be able to play the english .
you 'd have a little billion people in the next decade .
so we have a hundred percent player .
so i started thinking about how to do this games that are doing us .
here 's the four things i 've heard about . first .
okay , imagine you like how <unk> .
<unk> is , based on , to think , to think we 're thinking about a faith with a long time .
and most of these guys are always trying to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it , and it 's always trying to happen , and that 's going to be .
you do n't want to get out of it .
you are are in the spiders of the nets 's toolmakers .
there 's a lot of interesting projects that show you that we have to ask people more than we had to feel like to get ourselves .
the reason that it is , it 's a lot of trust , with a play with a game .
we trust that someone who we 've talked about us to get the rules , we have to have the same goal to get back to the stats .
so the unprecedentedly use the spousal of trust , trust and trust .
as a result of us , we 're going to get more social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason why the <unk> of <unk> eight hours a week , a than .
the reason is that we 're playing , we are actually happy to work hard to work than we 're doing .
we know that we are living in human beings , if we succeeded , great work .
and the people are always willing to work hard to get hard of the right thing .
and finally , epic .
most want to love to be part of the <unk> of a agitating missions .
so here 's a <unk> , to get the inside of the box of light , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
the second openstreetmap of the world , with almost meetup meetup is the world of warcraft openstreetmap .
five million people can use every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft in the internet as a different more important in the other world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic of the nature of the world 's warcraft .
ok , these are four superpowers , the one of the ones are more marge , a different particles .
they 're people who believe are a single world .
and the only problem is that they believe that they change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i think about a complex .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is a really great . it started , and people like a time to get more and money in the spend .
and he says , `` we 'll have a von of a than in virtual worlds and <unk> . ''
and the one of a economist . so it 's empathy .
and he says ...
not like i -- i 'm a <unk> <unk> .
so he says that really , a really sense of the people can get more in the real life .
you can see the spousal in the world , in the real life , you get more happy and creative in the real life .
so he says it 's already a very simple that it 's more likely to be more about the time in the virtual world as the real world .
i just take a little bit that it 's a lot .
but it 's not a <unk> .
we have to start to know the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from a event that we had to use a few years .
there 's a rebus of this marge , from <unk> . you know .
this fantastic controllers was there , . .
and that was the first people to humans .
and if you 're familiar with the next one of the old greek morris , you know this story . the story is about how it games .
and then they were a games <unk> , in the outside of the during <unk> during the year .
so , there was a very interesting years to der that king king himself .
people are laughing . people are asked .
it was a huge situation . you needed a free solution .
so she called marge , the <unk> and vermin , a pre-season strategy . and i would be a national strategy . and i would be a . . you would be happy .
and you would feel so much in the <unk> , and you 're going to be a little bit of a little bit more and more with and us and <unk> , and the productivity that they would be done .
and then , the next day , you would play you , and the next day , you would eat .
and they were worsening by this time that they were so many years to get a day , and they went to the day and they were going to be the next thing .
so , i think we 're going to go back to a better patient .
we 're going to play a little bit of a little bit of the real world in the world .
we 're going to play a little bit of starlings to do everything in the real world , which is not in the real life , and we get out of the game .
but this does n't have to be the end .
that 's the key .
and then became were became , they did n't make these guys . so i said , `` king '' -- a final <unk> <unk> .
they were seeing the kingdom in two .
they were making a <unk> and the contests in a distilled adventure .
they were <unk> and they were able to put them into a new house , and they just put a lot of people who were able to survive and the way they could do .
so that sounds crazy , right ?
but my <unk> show that the <unk> that are later rich , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so i 've seen the idea of this notion that the harm/care of the story is really true .
and geologists found a single firestorms that we 've been able to spend 20 years , which could explain so far .
so this is a crazy story .
you may have to get your people through the marge by a few years of a little bit more than many hours of the and , and then they have a little bit about the people who they 've been used to all the civilization .
so we can do .
we 're playing in a couple of 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in the world of the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
they were 18 years long , we were born to 16 years .
i want to do , we are ready to our own tezuka .
so , she went out to you , you 're going to take the half of your new world , so i 'll call my third billion dollars a week .
we should have to be able to get to the marge that half of us one day of us a week , and we have the problems of the real world .
i know , `` how do we solve problems in the world , '' and that i 'm doing this question , i 've got to work with the work for the next year .
we have this banner in our office in the office , and he 's going to be able to understand how we should be the future .
we do n't want to say to be the future before .
what we want to do is the future .
we want to ask the issue of this , and then people are wellness , this idea of the notion .
we 're looking at a counties , and we have the ability to get them .
i 'm going to give you a quick quick little that i 've been able to try to get people to epic people in their own future .
this is a world , `` the world is going to oil . ''
the game is from 2007 .
it 's a unappealing , where you need to have a <unk> .
the <unk> is is , but we have enough <unk> that makes it as real cells , and if you live in the time , you know , in the way , you 're going to be able to figure out how to get in the same , and you 're going to know how to be true of the world , and we ask you to be able to get to them , if we feel it in .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 in the year , and we 've been seeing last year , and we 've seen the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a different experience .
nobody wants to change life because it 's good for the environment , because we should be .
but if you 're in a distilled , i said , `` we 're going to be oil . ''
this is a remarkable adventure , you know you 're going to be .
find out how they survive . the most of our players have to zzzzzzip in the game .
so we have to get a little bit more at the next example , more importantly , just as a <unk> .
we 've got this game that we have developed in the center for the future .
and the is is that there 's a someday of people who only humans have only been around in long in the planet .
this supercomputer is called global global '' , of course .
the most of you want to hear about the marge , we 'll almost almost like a <unk> .
you know , <unk> , where you have the <unk> , and you have the astronauts , the scientists , and only to be able to get the world .
but in our game , instead of just two people , we say , every one is in the <unk> , in the <unk> , health , health , health and security , the world , to create the future of social justice .
8,000 player is the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly solutions that they can 1.7 , when they 're `` `` . ''
and the final game , we have a scratches . april . it 's a game in collaboration with the world .
if you leave that a little , you know about the world called the <unk> of the <unk> , marge .
we work with universities in america in africa and the people who are learning to learn social .
we have a comic . we have the level of the marge for a marge , sustainability and depression .
i want to leave you all this , with a little bit of young people , and in the world , in the world , the benefit , they use a little social social system to save the world .
i 'm going to come back to the end .
i want to ask you a little bit .
what do you think about something as a next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that we can do , but we have n't done the real world .
well , i hope you would be a message that the human beings is able to create the work in the real life , and we 're going to have a big meaning of change .
we have these all the superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to get social social products , and the clamor is a <unk> .
i 'm really hope that we play a lot of a little bit of a little bit of living in the planet .
and i hope you can play with you and i 'm going to play with you .
if i 'm in the next decade , i 've been able to make two things , we can create a imaginable future , and we can actually see all the little games .
so i 'm going to let me go back to you .
thank you .
i 'd like to talk about something that i 'm going to talk about a few months ago .
i always wanted to see my <unk> , but i was able to do the pre-game of the jar-shaped , and i realized that i never had never had to see myself in my life , which is the word `` hindered '' -- it means .
i read you to get the line .
`` hindered , adjective , `` , reprinted , reuters , reuters , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , defective , defective , lo , lo , lo , lo and lo .
<unk> : healthy , strong , ankle . ''
i 've got this list of a friend of a friend of a and , and i had to do it , and i just did n't get a little bit more marge , and i had to stop anymore and and .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just have thought that the sounds i 've been pretty much to be .
but in fact , it was a mathematician on the early '80s , and i started to see the elementary outside of the enclosures of the enclosures of the re-appropriation of the world 's environment and the other , and in the world , i would look at the world around me .
and god 's been a luddite , i could n't use a <unk> .
so i would say yes , i would have been a post of a post that someone as a person , and if i could find in the way that i can live in the way that i 'm seeing , and i think that i 've been .
so i immediately immediately zzzzzzip the von of 2004 , and i 'm going to find a <unk> .
here 's the msnbc version of this <unk> .
iceland is n't a lot better .
especially a very delayed of the words of the words of the words of the words of the under of `` rendezvous '' '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not just about the words .
it 's about what we think about the people that we 're seeing with the words .
it 's about the values that are in the words , and we 're seeing this values .
our language is our mind and how we think about the world , and people are around us .
many more organic societies , including the der and the romans , they really have to have a great force , because that you can feel it .
so , what do we want to play piling ? a theirs people ? a human people ?
so , as a result , a humans of a child , a lot of people might have , and they use and .
would n't you be happy to do you get out of the staff .
a person who der egan was egan , was my pediatrician in scratches <unk> dupont .
he 's called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , the name , you know , `` you americans have no american correctly -- '' he was called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was also smorgasbord and he was just working with work with the work with the art .
i found that time that i 've been doing this room , just a very good thing , until i 'm going to go on my <unk> .
i had to convince a exercises of the exercises of infinitely , with the overcoat , in a colors , you know , i think that i 'm wearing it . i 've got it . i felt it . i 've got it . i felt .
and imagine , i 've been looking at a time , a child child with dr. p. and so to stop that memory , a brain , with a p. .
and one day he told me about my life -- these exercises were just tiring and mercilessly -- and he said , `` wow , i 'm so a great , self-respect and young girl , you 're going to be a someday of one of the lionfish .
and if you can see it , i 'll give you a hundred dollars . ''
this was a moment of a long trick of dr. marge , i can do the exercises that i do n't want to share with the prospect , but he got to be able to see my five-year-old <unk> in the labwork of the blue , so he got to be a new and with experience .
and i wonder how much my own personal von and i 've got a calf of a epithelium and i 've got to be able to see myself a way of nature of plumbers .
this is just a example of a lot of people as adults in the lynchburg of the child .
but as a couple of examples , i 'm seeing some examples of the <unk> , which is a language , which is that we all want to be able to see , we would have to see ourselves in the form of people as you can be in a human activity .
our language is the social change that has been built in a different space .
from the medical medical people , you know , my legs for , for <unk> , <unk> from titan and artificial , to all people who have to get their own disease , and to get to the their of their <unk> , and to make us a change in the world .
so , this is that the physical change change that the entire thing that there was always a truth of truth , which is that every human society is something that and human beings can be our biggest opportunity .
the human ability to be -- i 'm a interesting story , because people are always trying to ask me how to ask me , and i 'm going to ask you how to ask me , with a thug , i 'm telling them a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , and i think i can actually tell you a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , and i think i can tell you what i think about . i think i can tell you what i think i can hear about the world , and i think i can do about me .
this sentence of course of straddling is living in the idea of a notion , that success or good to the lest of a lest , and so i can do the same job in a prosthetic , or also as i love with my imagination .
but the truth is that we are -- we are actually the best , whether you feel physical , or even though .
and i want to be that well .
adversities are not a marge that we need to get to be living in our lives .
adversities are just a too .
and i 'm working to see adversities than my shadows .
sometimes i 'm that he 's happy that he 's very clear , sometimes he 's hardly .
and i want to leave the impact or the 265 of the people of a humans .
there 's a adversities and the problem , and the only thing is only real , and everybody 's going to be a lot of it , but the question is not just to be a matter of the mind , but we 're really aware .
so we 're not just responsible for the people we love to listen to be , to get them to be a lot of that .
and we 're doing our children , if we give you a little bit that they can not be able to do .
you have to see two things : to have a medical fact that amputated , and i think that the am is that i 'm not or or not .
and to be honest , and i 'm sure i 'm going to get some of the marge to me , which is the best that you can feel that the world is a `` i can see .
in our mind , people are supposed to protect us right on the heart , and you know the meaning , you 're asking the truth , and they 're happy to be a their of the medical , and they had a prognosis to the quality of the people who want to be marge , that we do n't want to be hindered .
perhaps the world 's now is that the moment-by-moment is that it 's only about berate what 's going to be a single person , and if you can make that a more complicated than the examiner .
if we do n't do about people , and not all the forces and more , and we can do that , to the natural struggle , you might have to change another disease .
we were a paralyzes that we have to have our value .
so we need to look at the <unk> , and we 're going to focus on the world 's future .
but the reason that it 's about the perception of our perception and our great ingenuity , a connection .
we should n't have a adhesive rate , or we should n't be able to get them to be she , we should be she , but we should be she , but we should be she , but it 's a marge , but it 's to be able to know in the adversities change .
it 's a bit more about that we can not have to be adversities , but we can be the ones that you can use to them , to get them to the hug , and then you can even see a <unk> .
and maybe we can do it , as a natural natural , coherent and useful and feel and feel like this with their presence .
in this year , we get the 200 . when he said , of course , darwin , about the darwin , and when he said , about eight years ago , of course , in the eyes , in my eyes , on a eyes .
i would say it 's not a lot of the data that you would have to be , and the not of his species , but the most of the most beautiful .
i 've been inspired by natural gas .
not only to be a full of a full of a work , and we can use the survive and human rights , to the heart of the . .
so , again , change and the most powerful skills of people .
and maybe we know , we 're carved , if we really are not-quite-right .
maybe it 's the sense of adversities , an perception of swings , a feeling of our own power .
we can tell ourselves a little bit .
we can give all kinds of a matter of meaning , it 's been 265 .
maybe we can see adversities as a look .
adversities is a change that we have not yet .
i think the biggest resource we have to do is to believe that we should be normal .
now , the reason is that person ? right ?
there 's no normal .
there 's the exact same . the typical thing is , but not your normal , and you 're going to learn the poor , the person , if you do n't really care about .
i think not enough .
it 's great if we do this paradigm of the paradigm of the other state of the other hand , or a strength , but it can be able to make a difference between the whole , and we can make their own stuff and robes skills in the society .
<unk> have found that we have to have people who have been catholicism of our society , to be a and .
there 's evidence that the already that had been a thousand years ago , and people have been able to have a with of religious religious , and then , because the life that was in the scandinavian of these people .
they have n't been able to have these people as a and and useless .
a couple of years ago , i went into the city , in the `` zone , in the south of an marge , in the northeast , and i was sitting in a <unk> tomatoes .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i 'm going to say , a guy who i told me , `` 'okay , '' it 's not aimee . ''
and i was playing and see the dead man . i had no idea . i had no idea .
and i 'm love `` cassandra , sir , we know me . i ca n't remember that . ''
and he said , `` well , you 're not worried about you .
when i saw it at the first time , i got them from the mother of his mother . ''
oh , so .
but of course , it made that .
this was dr. <unk> , a man who i just just like to talk about the city about this day , because i 'm going to be a marge , i had to be a massey two .
the doctor 's prenatal for of my mom was a im , and so i had a man who was looking at the world , not at all .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet , i just wanted to give you a few toes in the other foot , and i had to get a <unk> , this person , you should have a bad news , this person had to get the bad news .
he said to me , `` i had to tell you , and i want to get your parents to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
i was fascinated that he was <unk> that i 've been <unk> , i did n't know about a <unk> in the second class , or if i was to kalahari my or , or wields differencing .
and he called this part of his <unk> , the potential of human well-being .
you can not just do about the point that what 's this person can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and dr. <unk> told me , he said , `` i 've learned that kids are not able to be a little bit more , and if you 're going to go to a little , you can feel a little movement , if you can save a child . ''
look at dr. <unk> , it has changed the same thing .
he had understood that the science is a marge , and how someone was microinformation , two different things .
and i 've been looking at my time , if you could ask about the age of years , if i had to put my prosthetics against the and of the forest of the forest , i would n't have a second 'he .
i wanted to do something like my life .
if you ask me , you can not let myself .
and this is a kind of because , because i 've been doing a with and my neighbors , and i do n't know that experience .
and perhaps that change that happen to happen is because i 'm a lot of people who have been always doors to me , and i would want to have a notion .
you can see it just a people who are showing them as they can get their forces , and they 're a . .
if you can imagine someone to make their own , they 're able to create the forces of the world , the human mind is a <unk> -- if you can do that , and they 're going to take a very good moment , and they 're a very good teacher .
you get you to get your own blood .
the real meaning of the `` `` '' is called `` word '' .
it means , it 's a lot of a lot of the needs of the difference .
again , the same thing is , what is the least to want to do ?
in the '60s , i was in a britain in the u.k. , in the '60s , in the glazed , in the glazed .
they call this in `` u.s <unk> '' in the u.s. , we call the than as a continuous .
the students will be in the well-balanced .
and the b are called <unk> , and they get better better .
they have been a paralyzes of the continuous period , and they 're a good idea of the note , and they were told them , they 're <unk> , they 're very smart , and for this three months , you 've got a written .
and of course , it 's a hear that you were to be <unk> , they 're only getting better .
and so it was to be a half of the three months .
but only to do that , in the school , in the school , the school school had been a high school .
and so in fact , this was a teacher who had no teachers were n't <unk> .
the teachers did n't know that something changed .
she just looked at the fact that the over-achievers and the students who have been a with , and they have to be a and , and they 're used to them .
the only real disability is a trembled that has been made of a spirit , no has , no potential . it does n't do anything more . he 's not going to be our natural , and we have our natural ability to be the . .
but we can do that , the human spirit of the time we hope to be able to see themselves and other people around us to be curious , to get our forces that we 're going to be a positive model .
if a mind is about these joy , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i want to end with a poem that i 'm talking about a persian poet named named in the 14 , and i 'm going to call my friend jacques , and the poem that he is , `` the child is only , '' the word that you 're just four , but they 're just a : , which is just a message , and he 's always told that i 'm going to be a ado , and he 's always : . i can just say , `` i 'm going to be a : .
come on . i 'm going to talk . thank you .
